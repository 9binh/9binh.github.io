      Commentaries on the CCP.</A></I>
      <P><B>Foreword</B>
      <P>The 55-year history of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is =
written=20
      with blood and lies. The stories behind this bloody history are =
not only=20
      brutally inhumane but also rarely known. Under the rule of the =
CCP, 60 to=20
      80 million innocent Chinese people have been killed, leaving their =
broken=20
      families behind. Many people wonder why the CCP kills. While the =
CCP=20
      continues its brutal persecution of Falun Gong practitioners and =
recently=20
      suppressed protesting crowds in Hanyuan with gunshots, people =
wonder if=20
      they will ever see the day when the CCP will learn to speak with =
words=20
      rather than guns.
      <P>Mao Zedong summarized the purpose of the Cultural Revolution, =
=93=85after=20
      the chaos and the world reaches peace again, 7 or 8 years after =
that, the=20
      chaos needs to happen again.=94 [1] In other words, there should =
be a=20
      cultural revolution every 7 or 8 years and a crowd of people needs =
to be=20
      killed every 7 or 8 years.
      <P>There are a supporting ideology and practical requirements =
behind the=20
      CCP=92s slaughters.
      <P>Ideologically, the CCP believes in the =93dictatorship of the=20
      proletariat" and "constant revolution under the dictatorship of =
the=20
      proletariat.=94 Therefore, after the CCP took over China, it =
killed the=20
      landowners to resolve problems with production relationships in =
rural=20
      areas; and =93killed the capitalists=94 to reach the goal of =
commercial and=20
      industrial reform and solve the production relationships in the =
cities.=20
      After these two classes were eliminated, the economic problems =
were=20
      basically solved. Establishing the culture of the ruling class =
also called=20
      for slaughter. The suppressions of the Hu Feng anti-Party group =
[2] and of=20
      the anti-rightists eliminated the intellectuals. Killing the =
Christians,=20
      Taoists and Buddhists solved the problem of religions. Mass =
murders during=20
      the Cultural Revolution established, culturally and politically, =
the CCP=92s=20
      absolute leadership. The Tiananmen Massacre was used to prevent =
political=20
      crisis and squelch democratic demands. The persecution of Falun =
Gong is to=20
      resolve the issues of belief and traditional healing. These =
actions were=20
      all necessary for the CCP to strengthen its power and maintain its =
rule in=20
      the face of continual financial crisis (prices for consumer goods=20
      skyrocketed after the CCP took over and China=92s economy =
collapsed after=20
      the Cultural Revolution), political crisis (people not following =
the=20
      Party=92s orders or wanting to share political rights with the =
Party) and=20
      crisis of belief (the disintegration of the former Soviet Union, =
political=20
      changes in Eastern Europe, and the Falun Gong issue). Except for =
the Falun=20
      Gong issue, all these political movements were used to revive the =
evil=20
      specter of the CCP and incite desire for revolution. The CCP also =
used=20
      these political movements to test CCP members, eliminating those =
who did=20
      not meet the Party=92s requirements.
      <P>Killing is also necessary for practical reasons. The CCP began =
as a=20
      group of thugs and scoundrels who killed to obtain power. Once =
this=20
      precedent was set, there was no going back. Constant terror was =
needed to=20
      intimidate people and force them to accept, out of fear, the =
absolute rule=20
      of the CCP.=20
      <P>On the surface, it may appear that the CCP was =93forced to =
kill,=94 and=20
      that various incidents just happened to trigger the CCP=92s =
comprehensive=20
      killing mechanism. In truth, periodical killing is required by the =
CCP,=20
      and these incidents serve to disguise the Party=92s need to kill. =
Without=20
      these painful lessons, people might begin to think the CCP was =
improving=20
      and start to demand democracy, like those idealistic students in =
the 1989=20
      democratic movement. Recurring slaughter every seven or eight =
years serves=20
      to refresh people=92s memory of terror and can warn the younger=20
      generation=97whoever works against the CCP, wants to challenge the =
CCP=92s=20
      absolute leadership, or wants to recover China=92s cultural =
history, will=20
      get a taste of the =93iron fist=94 of the dictatorship of the =
proletariat.
      <P>Killing has become one of the most essential ways for the CCP =
to=20
      maintain power. With the escalation of its bloody debts, giving up =
this=20
      mechanism of murder would encourage people to take vengeance for =
the CCP=92s=20
      criminal acts. Copious and thorough killing was not enough; it had =
to be=20
      done in a most brutal fashion to effectively intimidate the =
populace,=20
      especially early on when the CCP was expanding its government.
      <P>To instill the greatest terror, the targets of this destruction =
were=20
      arbitrarily chosen, so that no group felt secure. In every =
political=20
      movement, the CCP used the strategy of genocide. The =
=93suppression of=20
      reactionaries=94 did not suppress the =93actions=94 of the =
so-called=20
      reactionaries, but the =93people=94 who were the reactionaries. If =
one had=20
      been enlisted and served a few days in the Nationalist =
(Kuomintang, KMT)=20
      army but did absolutely nothing political after the CCP gained =
power, this=20
      person would still be killed because of his =93reactionary =
history.=94 In the=20
      process of land reform, in order to remove the root of the =
problem, the=20
      CCP often killed a landowner=92s entire family.
      <P>After 1949, the CCP persecuted more than half the people in =
China. An=20
      estimated 60 million to 80 million people died from unnatural =
causes. This=20
      number exceeds the total number of deaths in both World Wars =
combined.=20
      <P>As with other communist countries, the arbitrary killing done =
by the=20
      CCP includes brutal slayings of its own members in order to remove =

      dissidents who value a sense of humanity over the Party=92s =
principles. The=20
      CCP=92s rule of terror falls equally on itself in an attempt to =
maintain an=20
      invincible fortress.=20
      <P>In most countries, people show caring and love for one another. =
They=20
      hold respect for life and trust in a higher power. In the East, =
people=20
      say, =93Do not impose on others what you would not have yourself =
[3].=94 In=20
      the West, people say =93Love thy neighbor as thyself [4].=94 =
Conversely, the=20
      CCP holds that =93The history of all hitherto existing society is =
the=20
      history of class struggles [5].=94 In order to keep the =
=93struggles=94 within=20
      society, hatred must be generated. Not only does the CCP take =
lives, it=20
      encourages people to kill each other. It strives to desensitize =
people=20
      towards others=92 suffering by surrounding them with constant =
killing. It=20
      wants them to become numb from frequent exposure to inhumane =
brutality,=20
      and build the mentality that =93the best you can hope for is to =
avoid being=20
      persecuted.=94 All the lessons taught by brutal suppression enable =
the CCP=20
      to maintain its rule.
      <P>Besides the destruction of countless lives, the CCP also =
destroyed the=20
      soul of the Chinese people. Many people have become conditioned to =
react=20
      to the CCP=92s threats by surrendering all their principles and =
reason.=20
      These people=92s souls have died - something more frightening than =
physical=20
      death.
      <P>
      <CENTER>******************</CENTER>
      <P><B>I. Horrendous Massacre</B>=20
      <P>Before the CCP was in power, Mao Zedong wrote, =93We definitely =
do not=20
      apply a policy of benevolence to the reactionaries and towards the =

      reactionary activities of the reactionary classes [6].=94 In other =
words,=20
      even before the CCP took over Beijing, it had already made up its =
mind to=20
      carry out tyranny under the euphemism of the =93People=92s =
Democratic=20
      Dictatorship.=94 We will give a few examples.
      <P><B>Suppression of the Reactionaries and Land Reform</B>
      <P>In March of 1950, the CCP announced, =93Orders to Strictly =
Suppress=20
      Reactionary Elements,=94 also known as the movement of =
=93Suppression of the=20
      reactionaries.=94
      <P>Unlike all the emperors who granted amnesty to the whole =
country after=20
      they were crowned, the CCP started killing the minute it gained =
power. Mao=20
      Zedong said in a document, =93there are still many places where =
people are=20
      intimidated and dare not to kill the reactionaries openly in large =
scale=20
      [7].=94 In February 1951, the central CCP said that except for =
Zhejiang=20
      province and southern Anhui province, =93other areas which are not =
killing=20
      enough, especially in the large and mid-sized cities, should =
continue to=20
      kill as many as possible and should not stop too soon.=94 Mao even =

      recommended that =93in rural areas, to kill the reactionaries, =
there should=20
      be an average of 1/1000 of the total population killed=85in the =
cities, it=20
      should be less than that. [8]=94 The population of China at that =
time was=20
      approximately 600 million; this =93royal order=94 from Mao would =
have caused=20
      at least 600,000 deaths. Nobody knows where this ratio of 1/1000 =
came=20
      from. Perhaps on a whim, Mao decided these 600,000 lives should be =
enough=20
      to lay the foundation for creating fear among the people, and thus =
ordered=20
      it to happen.=20
      <P>Whether those killed deserved to die was not within the scope =
of the=20
      CCP=92s concern. =93The People=92s Republic of China Regulations =
for Punishing=20
      the Reactionaries,=94 announced in 1951, said that even those who =
=93spread=20
      rumors=94 can be =93immediately executed.=94
      <P>While the suppression of reactionaries was being implemented, =
land=20
      reform was also taking place on a large scale. The CCP had already =
started=20
      land reform within its occupied areas in the late 1920s. On the =
surface,=20
      land reform appeared to be a means for an ideal peaceful nation in =
which=20
      all would have land to farm, but it was really just an excuse to =
kill. Tao=20
      Zhu, who ranked 4th in the CCP, had a slogan for land reform: =
=93every=20
      village bleeds, every household fights,=94 indicating that in =
every village=20
      the landowners must die.=20
      <P>Land reform can be achieved without killing. The Taiwanese =
government=20
      implemented land reform by purchasing the property from =
landowners. As the=20
      CCP originated from a group of thugs who only knew how to rob, =
they=20
      naturally needed to kill the victims, so that the victims could =
never=20
      retaliate.=20
      <P>The most common way to kill during the land reform was known as =
the=20
      =93struggle meeting.=94 The CCP fabricated crimes and charged the =
landowners=20
      or rich farmers. The public was asked how they should be punished. =
CCP=20
      members or aggressive individuals were planted in the crowd to =
shout =93We=20
      should kill him!=94 and landowners and rich farmers were then =
killed on the=20
      spot. At that time, whoever owned land in the villages was called =
a=20
      =93bully.=94 Those who often took advantage of the peasants were =
called =93mean=20
      bullies;=94 those who often helped with repairing public =
facilities and=20
      donated money to schools and for natural disasters were called =
=93kind=20
      bullies;=94 and those who did nothing were called =
=93non-bullies.=94 The=20
      classification was meaningless, however, for all the =93bullies=94 =
ended up=20
      being executed right away regardless of their =93bully=94 =
category.=20
      <P>By the end of 1952, the CCP published the number of =
=93reactionary=20
      individuals=94 it killed: over 2.4 million people. Actually, the =
total death=20
      toll of former KMT government officials below the county level and =

      landowners was at least 5 million.=20
      <P>The suppression of the reactionaries and land reform had three =
direct=20
      results. First, former local officials who had been selected =
through=20
      clan-based autonomy were eliminated. Through suppressing the =
reactionaries=20
      and land reform, the CCP killed all the respectable gentlemen in =
the=20
      village who had been the local autonomous leaders, and realized =
complete=20
      control by installing a Party member in each village. Second, a =
huge=20
      amount of money was obtained by stealing and robbing. Third, =
civilians=20
      were terrorized by the brutal suppression against the landowners =
and rich=20
      farmers.
      <P><B>The =93Three Anti Campaign=94 and =93Five Anti Campaign=94 =
</B>
      <P>The suppression of reactionaries and the land reform mainly =
affected=20
      the countryside, while the subsequent =93Three Anti Campaign=94 =
and =93Five Anti=20
      Campaign=94 (also called the "Three-striking campaign" and =
"Five-striking=20
      campaign") could be regarded as the corresponding genocide in =
cities.=20
      <P>The =93Three Anti Campaign=94 began in December 1951 and =
targeted=20
      corruption, waste and bureaucracy. Some corrupt CCP officials were =

      executed. Soon afterwards, CCP attributed the corruption of its =
government=20
      officials to temptation by capitalists. Accordingly, the =93Five =
Anti=20
      Campaign,=94 against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state =
property, cheating=20
      on government contracts, and espionage of state economic =
information, was=20
      launched in January 1952.=20
      <P>The =93Five Anti Campaign=94 was essentially the taking of =
property and=20
      even life from the capitalists. Chen Yi, the mayor of Shanghai at =
that=20
      time, was debriefed on the sofa with a cup of tea in hand every =
night. He=20
      would ask leisurely, =93How many are airborne today?=94 meaning, =
=93How many=20
      businessmen jumped out of high buildings to commit suicide?=94 =
None of the=20
      capitalists could escape the =93Five Anti Campaign.=94 They were =
required to=20
      pay taxes =93evaded=94 as early as Guangxu Period (1875-1908) in =
the Qing=20
      Dynasty (1644-1911) when the Shanghai commercial market was =
initially=20
      established. The capitalists could not possibly afford to pay such =
=93taxes=94=20
      even with all their resources. They had no choice but to end their =
lives,=20
      but they didn=92t dare to jump into the Huangpu River, because if =
their=20
      bodies could not be found, the government would accuse them of =
fleeing to=20
      Hong Kong, and their family members would still be held =
responsible for=20
      the taxes. The capitalists instead jumped from tall buildings, =
leaving a=20
      corpse so that the CCP could see proof of their death. People =
didn=92t dare=20
      to walk next to tall buildings in Shanghai during that period for =
fear of=20
      being crushed by people jumping from the windows.=20
      <P>According to <I>Facts of the Political Campaigns after the =
Founding of=20
      the People=92s Republic of China</I> co-edited by four departments =
including=20
      the CCP History Research Center in 1996, during the =93Three Anti =
Campaign=94=20
      and =93Five Anti Campaign,=94 more than 323,100 people were =
arrested and over=20
      280 committed suicide or disappeared. In the =93Anti-Hu Fang =
campaign=94 in=20
      1955, over 500 were arrested, over 60 committed suicide, and 12 =
died from=20
      unnatural causes. In the ensuing suppression of the reactionaries, =
over=20
      21,300 people were executed, and over 4,300 committed suicide or=20
      disappeared.=20
      <P><B>The Great Famine</B>
      <P>The highest death toll was recorded during China=92s Great =
Famine shortly=20
      after the Great Leap Forward. [9] The chapter =93Great Famine=94 =
in the book=20
      <I>Historical Record of the People=92s Republic of China</I> =
published in=20
      February 1994 by <I>Red Flag Publishing House</I> states, =93The =
number of=20
      unnatural deaths and reduced births from 1959 to 1961 is estimated =
at=20
      about 40 million=85China=92s depopulation by 40 million is likely =
to be the=20
      greatest famine of the world in this century.=94=20
      <P>The Great Famine was distorted as a =93Three-Year Natural =
Disaster=94 by=20
      the CCP. In fact, those three years actually had good weather =
conditions=20
      without any massive flooding, drought, hurricane, tsunami, =
earthquake,=20
      frost, freeze, hail or plague of locusts. The =93disaster=94 was =
entirely=20
      caused by man. The Great Leap Forward campaign required everyone =
in China=20
      to become involved in steel-making, forcing farmers to leave their =
crops=20
      to rot in the field. Despite this, officials in every region =
escalated=20
      their claims on production yields. He Yiran, the First Secretary =
of the=20
      Liuzhou Prefecture Committee of CCP, personally fabricated the =
shocking=20
      output of =9365,000 kilograms of paddy rice per mu [10]=94 in =
Huanjiang=20
      County. This was right after the Lushan Plenum when the =
Suppression of=20
      Right Wing campaign was at its peak. In order to demonstrate that =
the CCP=20
      was correct all the time, the crops were expropriated by the =
government as=20
      a form of taxation according to these exaggerated yields. =
Consequently,=20
      the grain rations, seeds and staple foods of the peasants were all =

      confiscated. When the demand still could not be met, the peasants =
were=20
      accused of hiding their crops.=20
      <P>He Yiran once said that they must strive to get first place in =
the=20
      competition for highest output no matter how many people in =
Liuzhou would=20
      die. Some peasants were deprived of everything, and left with only =
some=20
      handfuls of rice hidden in the urine basin. The Party Committee of =
Xunle=20
      District, Huanjiang County even issued an order to forbid cooking, =
to=20
      prevent the peasants from eating the crops. Patrolmen searched the =

      countryside at night. If they saw light from a fire, they would =
proceed=20
      with a search and raid. Many peasants did not even dare to cook =

      <P>Historically, in times of famine, the government would provide =
rice=20
      porridge, distribute the crops and allow victims to flee from the =
famine.=20
      The CCP, however, regarded fleeing from the famine as a disgrace =
to the=20
      Party=92s prestige, and ordered patrolmen to block roadways to =
prevent=20
      victims from escaping the famine. Anyone caught trying to take =
crops from=20
      the grain depots was labeled as a counter-revolutionary and was =
shot.=20
      Peasants were being starved in Gansu, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, =
Hubei,=20
      Hunan, Sichuan and Guangxi provinces. Still, they were forced to =
take part=20
      in irrigation work, dam construction, and steel-making. Many =
dropped to=20
      the ground and never got up again. Peasants died out family by =
family.=20
      Those who survived had no strength to bury the dead. Entire =
villages died=20
      out as families starved to death one after another.=20
      <P>In the most serious famines in China=92s history prior to the =
CCP,=20
      families have exchanged children to eat, but nobody ever ate their =

      children. Under the CCP=92s reign, however, people were driven to =
eat those=20
      who died, cannibalize those who fled from other regions, and even =
kill and=20
      eat their own children. The writer Sha Qing depicted this scene in =
his=20
      book <I>Yi Xi Da Di Wan</I> (<I>An Obscure Land of Bayou</I>): In =
a=20
      peasant=92s family, a father was left with only his son and =
daughter during=20
      the Great Famine. One day, the daughter was driven out of the =
house by her=20
      father. When she came back, she could not find her younger =
brother, but=20
      saw white oil floating in the cauldron and a pile of bones next to =
the=20
      stove. Several days later, the father added more water to the pot, =
and=20
      called his daughter to come closer. The girl was frightened, and =
pleaded=20
      with her father from outside the door, =93Daddy, please don=92t =
eat me. I can=20
      collect firewood and cook food for you. If you eat me, nobody else =
will do=20
      this for you.=94=20
      <P>The final extent and number of tragedies like this is unknown, =

      CCP distorted them as a noble honor, and claimed that the CCP was =

to tout=20
      itself as =93great, glorious and correct.=94=20
      <P>After the Lushan Plenum was held in 1959, General Peng Dehuai =
[11] was=20
      stripped of his power for speaking out for the people. A group of=20

were=20
      dismissed from their posts, arrested and investigated. After that, =
no one=20
      dared to speak out. At the time of the Great Famine, instead of =
reporting=20
      the truth, they concealed the vast number of deaths from =

      order to protect their official positions. Gansu province even =
refused=20
      food aid from Shaanxi Province, with the claim of having too great =
a food=20
      surplus in Gansu.=20
      <P>This Great Famine could be considered the CCP=92s qualification =

      <P>Ten years later, on July 20, 1999, Jiang Zemin began his =

      <P>In public records, the killings by the CCP nowadays appear to =
have=20
      greatly declined from the previous numbers in the millions. There =
are two=20
      reasons for this misperception. First, the CCP culture has warped =
the=20
      minds of the Chinese people to become detached and cynical. =
Second,=20
      because of excessive corruption and embezzlement by CCP government =

      officials, the Chinese economy has declined into a =93transfusion =
economy,=94=20
      depending on foreign capital to sustain its economic development =
and=20
      social stability. The economic sanctions after the Tiananmen =

started=20
      as early as before the Sino-Japanese War.

      movements. He would recommend it to everyone in the country who =
was=20
      willing to understand such an evil force in this world.
      <P>In this book, De Jaegher and Kuhn told stories about how the =
CCP used=20
      violence to terrify people into submission. For instance, one day =
the=20
      Communist Party required everyone to go to the square in the =
village.=20
      Teachers led the children to the square from school. The purpose =
for the=20
      gathering was to watch the killing of 13 patriotic young people. =
After=20
      announcing the victims=92 fabricated charges, the communist leader =
ordered=20
      the horrified teacher to lead the children to sing patriotic =
songs.=20
      Appearing on the stage amid the songs were not dancers, but rather =
an=20
      executioner holding a sharp knife in his hands. The executioner =
was a=20
      ruthless, powerful young communist soldier with strong arms. The =
soldier=20
      went behind the first victim, quickly raised the big sharp knife =
and=20
      struck downwards, and the first head fell to the ground. Blood =
sprayed out=20
      like a fountain as the head rolled on the ground and the =
children's=20
      hysterical singing turned into chaotic screaming and crying. The =
teacher=20
      kept the beat, trying to keep the songs going; her bell was heard =
ringing=20
      in the chaos.
      <P>The executioner chopped 13 times and 13 heads fell onto the =
ground.=20
      After that, many communist soldiers came over, cut the victims' =
bodies=20
      open and took out their hearts for a feast. All the brutality was =
done in=20
      front of the children. The children went all pale due to the =
terror, and=20
      some started throwing up. The teacher scolded them, and lined them =
up to=20
      return to school.
      <P>De Jaegher and Kuhn often saw children being forced to watch =
killings.=20
      The children became used to the bloody killing, and some even =
started to=20
      enjoy the excitement.
      <P>When the CCP felt that simple killing was not horrifying and =
exciting=20
      enough, they invented all kinds of cruel tortures. For example, =
forcing=20
      someone to swallow a large amount of salt without letting him =
drink any=20
      water=97the victim would suffer until he died of thirst; or =
stripping=20
      someone naked and forcing him to roll on broken glass; or creating =
a hole=20
      in a frozen river in the winter, then throwing the victim into the =

      hole=97the victim would either freeze to death or drown.=20
      <P>De Jaegher and Kuhn wrote that a CCP member in Shanxi province =
invented=20
      a terrible torture. One day when he was wandering in the city, he =
stopped=20
      and stared at a big boiling vat in front of a restaurant. Later he =

      purchased several giant vats, and immediately arrested some=20
      anti-communists. During the hasty trial, the vats were filled with =
water=20
      and heated to boiling. Three victims were stripped naked and =
thrown into=20
      the vats to boil to death after the trial. At Pingshan, De Jaegher =
and=20
      Kuhn witnessed a father being skinned alive. The CCP members =
forced the=20
      son to watch and participate in the inhumane torture, to see his =
father=20
      die in excruciating pain and listen to his father's screams. The =
CCP=20
      members poured vinegar and acid onto the father's body and then a =
whole=20
      human skin was quickly peeled off. They started from the back, =
then up to=20
      the shoulders and soon the skin from his whole body was peeled =
off,=20
      leaving only the skin on the head. The father died in minutes.
      <P><B>The Red Terror during "Red August" and the Guangxi =
Cannibalism</B>
      <P>After gaining its absolute control over the country, the CCP =
did not=20
      stop its violence at all. During the Cultural Revolution, such =
violence=20
      became worse.
      <P>On August 18, 1966, Mao Zedong met with the Red Guard =
representatives=20
      on the tower of Tiananmen Square. Song Binbin, daughter of a =
communist=20
      leader Song Renqiong, put a Red Guard sleeve emblem on Mao. When =
Mao=20
      learned Song Binbin's name means gentle and polite, he said, "We =
need more=20
      violence." Song changed her name to Song Yaowu (literally meaning =
"want=20
      violence".)
      <P>Violent armed attacks soon spread to the whole country. The =
younger=20
      generation educated in communist atheism had no fears or concerns. =
Under=20
      the direct leadership of the CCP and guided by Mao's instructions, =
the Red=20
      Guards, being fanatic, ignorant, and holding themselves above the =
law,=20
      started beating people and ransacking homes nationwide. In many =
areas, all=20
      the "five black classes" (landlords, rich farmers, reactionaries, =
bad=20
      elements, and rightists) and their family members were killed. A =
typical=20
      example was in Daxing County near Beijing, where from August 27 to =

      September 1 of 1966, a total of 325 people were killed in 48 local =

      Brigades of 13 People=92s Communes. The oldest killed was 80 years =
old, the=20
      youngest only 38 days. Twenty-two entire households were killed =
with not=20
      one member left.
      <P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Beating a person to death was a common scene. On =
Shatan=20

        chains and leather belts until she could not move any more, and =
still a=20
        female Red Guard jumped on her body and stomped on her stomach. =
The old=20
        woman died at the scene. =85 Near Chongwenmeng, when the Red =
Guards=20
        searched the home of a "landlord's wife" (a lonely widow), they =
forced=20
        each neighbor to bring a pot of boiling water to the scene and =
they=20
        poured the boiling water down the old lady's collar until her =
body was=20
        cooked. Several days later, the old lady was found dead in the =
room, her=20
        body covered with maggots. =85 There were many different ways of =
killing,=20
        including beating to death with batons, cutting with sickles and =

        strangling to death with ropes. =85 The way to kill babies was =
the most=20
        brutal: the killer stepped on one leg of a baby and pulled the =
other=20
        leg, tearing the baby in half. (<I>Investigation of Daxing =
Massacre</I>=20
        by Yu Luowen) [12] </BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>The Guangxi cannibalism was even more inhumane than the Daxing=20
      Massacre. Writer Zheng Yi, Author of a book on the Guangxi =
cannibalism,=20
      described the event as taking place in three stages.
      <P>The first was the beginning stage when the terror was covert =
and=20
      gloomy. County annals documented a typical scene: at midnight, the =
killers=20
      tip-toed to find their victim and cut him open to remove his heart =
and=20
      liver. Because they were inexperienced and scared, they took his =
lung by=20
      mistake, then they had to go back again. Once they had cooked the =
heart=20
      and liver, some people brought liquor from home, some brought =
seasoning,=20
      and then all the killers ate the human organs in silence by the =
light of=20
      the fire in the oven.
      <P>The second stage was the peak stage when the terror was open =
and=20
      public. During this stage, veteran killers had gained experience =
in how to=20
      remove hearts and livers while the victim was still alive, and =
they taught=20
      others, refining their techniques to perfection. For example when =
cutting=20
      open a living person, the killers only needed to cut a cross on =
the=20
      victim's belly, step on his body (if the victim was tied to a =
tree, bump=20
      his lower abdomen with the knee) and the heart and other organs =
would just=20
      fall out. The head killer was entitled to the heart, liver and =
genitals=20
      while others would take what was left. The grand and yet dreadful =
scenes=20
      were adorned with flying flags and slogans.
      <P>The third stage was the crazy stage when cannibalism became a =
massive=20
      widespread movement. In Wuxuan County, like wild dogs eating =
corpses=20
      during an epidemic, people were crazily eating other people. Often =
victims=20
      were first "publicly criticized," and killing happened every time=20
      thereafter, followed by cannibalism. As soon as a victim fell to =
the=20
      ground, dead or alive, people took out the knives they had =
prepared and=20
      surrounded the victim, cutting any body part they could get hold =
of. At=20
      this stage, ordinary citizens were all involved in the =
cannibalism. The=20
      hurricane of "class struggle" blew away any sense of sin and human =
nature=20
      from people=92s minds. Cannibalism spread like an epidemic and =
people=20
      enjoyed cannibalistic feasts. Any part of the human body was =
edible,=20
      including the heart, meat, liver, kidneys, elbows, feet, and =
tendons.=20
      Human bodies were cooked in many different ways including boiling, =

      steaming, stir-frying, baking, frying and barbecuing =85 People =
drank liquor=20
      or wine and played games while eating human bodies. During the =
peak of=20
      this movement, even the cafeteria of the highest government =
organization,=20
      Wuxuan County Revolutionary Committee, offered human dishes.
      <P>Readers should not mistakenly think such a festival of =
cannibalism was=20
      purely an unorganized behavior by the people. The CCP was a =
totalitarian=20
      organization controlling every single cell of the society. Without =
the=20
      CCP's encouragement and manipulation, the cannibalism movement =
could not=20
      have happened at all.
      <P>A song written by the CCP in praise of itself says, "The old =
society=20
      [13] turned humans into ghosts, the new society turned ghosts into =

      humans." However, these killings and cannibalistic feasts tell us =
that the=20
      CCP could turn a human being into a monster or a devil, because =
the CCP=20
      itself is crueler than any monster or devil.
      <P><B>Persecution of Falun Gong</B>
      <P>As the people in China step into the era of computers and space =
travel,=20
      and can talk privately about human rights, freedom and democracy, =
many=20
      people think that the gruesome and disgusting atrocities are all =
in the=20
      past. The CCP has donned civilian clothing and is ready to connect =
with=20
      the world.
      <P>But that=92s far from the truth. When the CCP discovered that =
there is a=20
      group that does not fear its cruel torture and killing, the means =
they=20
      used became even more manic. The group that has been persecuted in =
this=20
      way is Falun Gong.
      <P>The Red Guards=92 violence and the cannibalism in Guangxi =
Province aimed=20
      at eliminating the victim=92s body, killing someone in several =
minutes or=20
      several hours. Falun Gong practitioners are persecuted to force =
them to=20
      give up their belief in Truthfulness, Compassion, Tolerance. Also, =
the=20
      cruel tortures often last for several days, several months or even =
several=20
      years. It=92s estimated that more than 10,000 Falun Gong =
practitioners have=20
      died as a result of torture.
      <P>Falun Gong practitioners who suffered all kinds of tortures and =
escaped=20
      from the jaw of death have recorded more than 100 cruel torture =
methods;=20
      the following are only several examples.
      <P>Cruel beating is the most commonly used torture method to abuse =
Falun=20
      Gong practitioners. The police and head prisoners directly beat=20
      practitioners and also instigate other prisoners to beat =
practitioners.=20
      Many practitioners have become deaf from these beatings, their =
outer ear=20
      tissues have been broken off, their eyeballs crushed, their teeth =
broken,=20
      and their skull, spine, ribcage, collarbone, pelvis, arms and legs =
have=20
      been broken; arms and legs have been amputated due to the =
beatings. Some=20
      torturers have ruthlessly pinched and crushed male =
practitioners=92=20
      testicles and kicked female practitioners=92 genital areas. If the =

      practitioners did not give in, torturers would continue the =
beating until=20
      the practitioners=92 skin was torn and the flesh gaped open. =
Practitioners'=20
      bodies have become completely deformed from torture and covered in =
blood,=20
      yet the guards have still poured salt water on them and continued =
to shock=20
      them with electric batons. The smells of blood and of flesh =
burning mix=20
      together and the screams of agony are miserable. Meanwhile, the =
torturers=20
      also use the plastic bags to cover practitioners=92 heads in an =
attempt to=20
      make practitioners yield out of fear of suffocation.
      <P>Electric shock is another method commonly used in Chinese =
forced labor=20
      camps to torture Falun Gong practitioners. The police have used =
electric=20
      batons to shock practitioners=92 sensitive parts of the body, =
including the=20
      mouth, top of the head, chest, genitalia, hips, thighs, soles of =
the feet,=20
      female practitioners=92 breasts, and male practitioners=92 penis. =
Some police=20
      have shocked practitioners with several electric batons =
simultaneously=20
      until burning flesh could be smelled and the injured parts were =
dark and=20
      purple. Sometimes, the head and anus are shocked at the same time. =
The=20
      police have often used ten or even more electric batons =
simultaneously to=20
      beat the practitioners for a long time. Normally an electric baton =
has=20
      tens of thousands volts. When it discharges, it emits blue light =
with a=20
      static-like sound. When the electric current goes through a =
person's body,=20
      it feels like one is being burned or being bitten by snakes. Every =
shock=20
      is very painful like snakebite. The victim's skin turns red, =
broken,=20
      burned and festering. There are even more powerful batons with =
higher=20
      voltage that make the victim feel like his head is being hit with =
a=20
hammer.
      <P>Police also use lit cigarettes to burn practitioners' hands, =
face,=20
      bottoms of the feet, chest, back, nipples, and so on. They use =

a breath=20

time,=20

an=20

broken=20

tortured=20

force=20

      <P>Because the CCP is based on Party principles instead of =
morality and=20
      justice, the loyalty of its members, especially senior officials, =
to the=20
      supreme leader is a central question. Because of this, the Party =
needs to=20
      create an atmosphere of terror by killing its members so the =
survivors see=20
      that when the supreme dictator wants someone to die, that person =
will die=20
      tragically.
      <P>The internal fights of Communist Parties are well known. All =
members of=20
      the Politburo of the Russian Communist Party in the first two =
terms,=20
      except Lenin, who had died, and Stalin himself, were executed or =
committed=20

five=20
      Commanders-in-Chief were executed, all 10 of the secondary army=20
      Commanders-in-Chief were executed, 57 of the 85 army corps =
commanders were=20
      executed, and 110 of the 195 division commanders were executed.
      <P>The CCP always advocates =93brutal struggles and merciless =
attacks.=94 Such=20
      tactics not only target people outside the Party. As early as the=20
      revolutionary period in Jiangxi Province, the CCP had already =
killed so=20
      many people in the Anti-Bolshevik Corps (AB Corps) [15] that only =
a few=20
      survived to fight in the war. In the city of Yan'an, the Party =
carried out=20
      a =93Rectification=94 campaign. After becoming politically =
established, it=20
      eliminated Gao Gang, Rao Shushi [16], Hu Feng, and Peng Dehuai. By =
the=20
      time of the Cultural Revolution, almost all the senior members =
within the=20
      Party had been eliminated. None of the former CCP=92s =
secretary-generals met=20
      with a good ending.
      <P>Liu Shaoqi, a former Chinese president who was once the No.2 =
figure in=20
      the nation, died tragically. On the day of his 70th birthday, Mao =
Zedong=20
      and Zhou Enlai [17] specifically told Wang Dongxing (Mao=92s lead =
guard) to=20
      bring Liu Shaoqi a birthday present, a radio, in order to let him =
hear the=20
      official report of the Eighth Plenary Session of the twelfth =
Central=20
      Committee, which said, =93Forever expel the traitor, spy, and =
renegade Liu=20
      Shaoqi from the Party and continue to expose and criticize Liu =
Shaoqi and=20
      his accomplices=92 crimes of betrayal and treason.=94
      <P>Liu Shaoqi was crushed mentally and his illnesses rapidly =
deteriorated.=20
      Because he was tied to the bed for a long time and could not move, =
his=20
      neck, back, hip, and heels had painful festering bedsores. When he =
felt=20
      great pain he would grab some clothes, articles, or other =
people=92s arms,=20
      and not let go, so people simply put a hard plastic bottle into =
each of=20
      his hands. When he died, the two hard plastic bottles had become =
hourglass=20
      shaped from his gripping.
      <P>By October 1969, Liu Shaoqi=92s body had started to rot all =
over and the=20
      infected pus had a strong odor. He was as thin as a rail and on =
the verge=20
      of death. But the special inspector from the central Party =
committee did=20
      not allow him to take a shower or turn over his body to change his =

      clothes. Instead, they stripped off all his clothes, wrapped him =
in a=20
      quilt, sent him by air from Beijing to Kaifeng city, and locked =
him up in=20
      the basement of a solid blockhouse. When he had high fever, they =
not only=20
      did not give him medication, but also transferred the medical =
personnel=20
      away. When Liu Shaoqi died, he was completely out of shape, and =
had=20
      disheveled white hair that was two feet long. Two days later, at =
midnight,=20
      he was cremated as a person with a highly infectious disease. His =
bedding,=20
      pillow and other things left behind were all cremated. Liu=92s =
death card=20
      reads: Name: Liu Weihuang; occupation: unemployed; reason for =
death:=20
      disease. The CCP tortured the president of the nation to death =
like this=20

      =93revolution.=94 The Khmer Rouge is a typical example.
      <P>Pol Pot=92s Khmer Rouge only existed for four years in =
Cambodia.=20
      Nevertheless, from 1975 to 1978, more than two million people, =
including=20
      over 200,000 Chinese, were killed in this small country that had a =

      population of only eight million people.
      <P>The Khmer Rouge=92s crimes are countless, but we will not =
discuss them=20
      here. We must, however, talk about its relationship with the CCP.
      <P>Pol Pot worshipped Mao Zedong. Beginning in 1965, he visited =
China four=20
      times to listen to Mao Zedong=92s teachings in person. As early as =
November=20
      1965, Pol Pot stayed in China for three months. Chen Boda and =
Zhang=20
      Chunqiao discussed with him theories such as =93political power =
grows out of=20
      the barrel of a gun,=94 =93class struggles,=94 =93dictatorship of =
the=20
      proletariat,=94 and so on. Later, these became the basis for how =
he ruled=20
      Cambodia. After returning to Cambodia, Pol Pot changed the name of =
his=20
      party to the Cambodian Communist Party and established =
revolutionary bases=20
      according to the CCP=92s model of encircling cities from the =
countryside.
      <P>In 1968, the Cambodian Communist Party officially established =
an army.=20
      At the end of 1969, it had slightly more than 3,000 people. But in =
1975,=20
      before attacking and occupying the city of Phnom Penh, it had =
become a=20
      well equipped and brave fighting force of 80,000 soldiers. This =
was=20
      completely due to the CCP=92s support. The book <I>Documentary of =
Supporting=20
      Vietnam and Fighting with America</I> by Wang Xiangen says that in =
1970=20
      China gave Pol Pot armed equipment for 30,000 soldiers. In April =
1975, Pol=20
      Pot took the capital of Cambodia, and two months later, he went to =
Beijing=20
      to pay a visit to the CCP and listen to instructions. Obviously, =
if the=20
      Khmer Rouge=92s killing had not been backed by the CCP=92s =
theories and=20
      material support, it could not have been done.
      <P>For example, after Prince Sihanouk=92s two sons were killed by =
the=20
      Cambodian Communist Party, the Cambodian Communist Party =
obediently sent=20
      Sihanouk to Beijing on Zhou Enlai=92s orders. It was well known =
that when=20
      the Cambodian Communist Party killed people, they would =93even =
kill the=20
      fetus=94 to prevent any possible troubles in the future. But at =
Zhou Enlai=92s=20
      request, Pol Pot obeyed without protest.
      <P>Zhou Enlai could save Sihanouk with one word, but the CCP did =
not=20
      object to the more than 200,000 Chinese who were killed by the =
Cambodian=20
      Communist Party. At that time, the Chinese Cambodians went to the =
Chinese=20
      embassy for help, but the embassy ignored them.
      <P>In May 1998, when a large-scale killing and raping of ethnic =
Chinese=20
      took place in Indonesia, the CCP did not say a word. It did not =
offer any=20
      help, and even blocked the news inside China. It seems that the =

creatively=20
      developed an unprecedented evil in history and around the world. =
It uses=20

superstructure=20
      (the culture of the ruling class) under the dictatorship of the=20

the=20
      superstructure, but the superstructure can in turn act on the =
economic=20
      base. In order to strengthen the superstructure, especially the =
Party=92s=20

      Army massacring its people.
      <P>(4) Killing people with different beliefs
      <P>Controlling belief is the lifeline of the CCP. In order to let =
its=20
      heresy deceive people for the time being, the CCP started to =
eliminate all=20
      religions and belief systems at the beginning of its rule. When =
facing a=20
      spiritual belief in a new era=97Falun Gong=97the CCP took out its =
butcher=92s=20
      knife again. The CCP started the persecution of Falun Gong =
practitioners=20
      by taking advantage of Falun Gong=92s principles of Truthfulness,=20
      Compassion, and Tolerance and the fact that practitioners do not =
lie, do=20
      not use violence, and will not cause social instability. After =
gaining=20
      experience in persecuting Falun Gong, the CCP made itself better =
able to=20
      eliminate people of other faiths. This time, Jiang Zemin and the =
CCP=20
      themselves came to the front of the stage to kill instead of =
utilizing=20
      other people or groups.
      <P>(5) Killing people in order to hide the truth
      <P>The people=92s right to know is another weak point of the CCP; =
it also=20
      kills people in order to block information. In the past, =
=93listening to the=20
      enemy=92s radio broadcasting=94 was a felony that could send =
people to prison.=20
      Recently, in response to multiple incidents of the interception of =
the=20
      state-owned satellite or cable television system aiming at =
clarifying=20
      truth the persecution of Falun Gong, Jiang Zemin sent down the =
secret=20
      order to =93kill instantly without mercy.=94 Liu Chengjun, who =
carried out=20
      such an interception, was tortured to death. The CCP has mobilized =
the=20
      =91610 Office=92 (an organization similar to the Gestapo in Nazi =
Germany that=20
      was created to persecute Falun Gong), the police, prosecutors, =
courts and=20
      a massive Internet police system to monitor people closely.
      <P>(6) The Party seeking its own interests through taking away the =
right=20
      to life
      <P>The CCP=92s theory of continuous revolution actually means it =
will never=20
      give up its power. Currently, embezzlement and corruption inside =
the CCP=20
      have developed into conflicts between the Party=92s absolute =
leadership and=20
      people=92s right to life. When people organize to legally protect =
their=20
      rights, the CCP uses violence, waving its butcher=92s knife toward =
so-called=20
      =93leaders=94 of these movements. The CCP has already prepared =
over one=20
      million armed police for this purpose. Today, the CCP is much =
better=20
      prepared for killing than it was at the time of the Tiananmen =
Massacre on=20
      June 4th 1989, when it had to temporarily mobilize its military =
force.=20
      However, while forcing its people into a dead end, the CCP has =
also forced=20
      itself into a dead end. The CCP has come to such an extremely =
vulnerable=20
      stage that it even =93takes trees and grass as enemies when the =
wind blows,=94=20
      as the Chinese saying goes.
      <P>We can see from above that the CCP is an evil specter in =
nature. No=20
      matter how it changes in different times and different places, the =
CCP=20
      killed people before, is killing people now, and will continue to =
kill in=20
      the future in order to maintain absolute control.
      <P><B>Different Killing Patterns under Different Circumstances</B>
      <P><B>A. Propaganda Prior to Action</B>
      <P>The CCP has used many different ways to kill people depending =
on the=20
      period of time. In most situations, the CCP created propaganda =
before=20
      actually killing anyone. The CCP would then say =93only killing =
could=20
      relieve the public=92s indignation,=94 as if people had requested =
the CCP to=20
      kill. In fact, the CCP instigated the public=92s indignation.
      <P>For example, the drama "White Haired Girl=94 [24], which =
totally distorts=20
      a folk legend, was used as a tool in propaganda campaigns. The =
stories of=20
      rent collection and water dungeons told in the drama, =93Liu =
Wencai,=94 are=20
      fabricated too. The purpose of these false stories is to =
=93educate=94 people=20
      to hate landowners. The CCP commonly demonizes their enemies, even =
China=92s=20
      president. In particular, the CCP staged a self-immolation =
incident on=20
      Tiananmen Square in January 2001 to incite people to hate Falun =
Gong, and=20
      then redoubled their massive genocidal campaign against Falun =
Gong. Not=20
      only has the CCP not changed its ways of killing people, but =
instead has=20
      perfected them by employing new information technology. The CCP =
could only=20
      deceive Chinese people in the past, but now it also deceives =
people around=20
      the world.
      <P><B>B. Instigating the Masses to Kill People</B>
      <P>The CCP not only kills people through the mechanism of its=20
      dictatorship, but also provokes people to kill each other. Even if =
CCP had=20
      some regulations when it began to persecute and kill, by the time =
it=20
      incited people to join in, nothing could stop the slaughter. For =
example,=20
      when the CCP was carrying out its land reform, they allowed any =
local land=20
      reform committee willfully to execute landowners.
      <P><B>C. Destroying One=92s Spirit before Killing His Physical =
Body</B>
      <P>Another pattern is to crush one=92s spirit before killing the =
human body.=20
      In China=92s history, even the leaders of the most cruel and =
ferocious=20
      dynasty in China=92s history, the Qin (221 =96 207 BC), never =
destroyed=20
      people=92s spirits. The CCP has never given people the chance to =
die like a=20
      martyr. They promulgated policies such as lightening the sentences =
of=20
      those who offered concessions, making them stricter for those who=20
      resisted, and =93lowering one's head to admit the crime is the =
only way to=20
      survive.=94 The CCP forces people to give up their own thoughts =
and beliefs,=20
      making them die without dignity. Those who died with dignity would =

      encourage more followers. Only when people die in a humiliating =
and=20
      shameful way can the CCP achieve its purpose of controlling =
people. The=20
      reason that the CCP persecutes Falun Gong with extreme cruelty and =

      ferocity is that Falun Gong practitioners consider their beliefs =
more=20
      important than their lives. When the CCP was unable to destroy =
their=20
      dignity, it did everything it could to destroy them physically.
      <P><B>D. Killing People by Alliances and Alienation</B>
      <P>When killing people, the CCP would use both the carrot and the =
stick by=20
      befriending and alienating people. The CCP always tries to attack =
a small=20
      portion of the population, around 5 percent. The CCP considers the =

      majority of the population to be good and only needing to be =
=93educated.=94=20
      We can divide the CCP=92s educational methods into two parts: =
education=20
      through terror, and education through kindness. Education through =
terror=20
      uses fear to show people that those who oppose the CCP will come =
to no=20
      good end, making them stay far away from those previously attacked =
by the=20
      Party. Education through kindness lets people see that if they can =
earn=20
      the trust of the CCP and stand in alliance with the CCP, they will =
not=20
      only be safe but also have a good chance to be promoted or gain =
other=20
      benefits. Lin Biao [25] once said, =93A small portion [suppressed] =
today and=20
      a small portion tomorrow, soon there will be a large portion in =
total.=94=20
      Those who rejoiced surviving one movement often became victims of =
the=20
next.
      <P><B>E. Nipping Potential Threats in the Bud and Secret =
Extra-Judicial=20
      Killings</B>
      <P>Recently the CCP has developed the killing pattern of nipping =
problems=20
      in the bud and killing secretly outside the law. For example, as =
workers=92=20
      strikes or peasants=92 protests become more common, the CCP =
eliminates the=20
      movements before they can grow by arresting the =93ringleaders=94 =
and=20
      sentencing them to severe punishment. As freedom and human rights =
become=20
      the common understanding and trend throughout the world, the CCP =
doesn=92t=20
      sentence any Falun Gong practitioner to the death penalty. =
However, under=20
      Jiang Zemin=92s instigation of =93no one is responsible for =
killing Falun Gong=20
      practitioners,=94 Falun Gong practitioners have tragically been =
killed all=20
      over the country. Although the Chinese Constitution stipulates the =

      citizens=92 right of appeal, the CCP uses plainclothes policeman =
or hires=20
      local thugs to stop, arrest and send appellants back home, =
sometimes even=20
      putting them into labor camps.=20
      <P><B>F. Killing One Person to Warn Others</B>
      <P>The persecutions of Zhang Zhixin, Yu Luoke and Lin Zhao are all =
such=20
      examples. [26]
      <P><B>G. Using Suppression to Conceal the Truth of Killing</B>
      <P>Famous people with international influence are usually =
suppressed, but=20
      not killed. The purpose of this is to conceal the killing of those =
who=20
      have no influence or power and whose deaths will not draw public=20
      attention. For example, during the campaign of suppressing the=20
      reactionaries, the CCP did not kill high-ranking generals such as =
Long=20
      Yun, Fu Zuoyi and Du Yuming, instead killing lower level KMT =
officers and=20
      soldiers.
      <P>The CCP=92s use of killing over a long period of time has =
distorted the=20
      Chinese people=92s souls. Now, in China, many people have the =
tendency to=20
      kill. When terrorists attacked the U.S. on September 11, 2001, =
many=20
      Chinese people cheered the attacks on Mainland Chinese Internet =
message=20
      boards. Advocates of =93unrestricted war=94 against the U.S. and =
the Western=20
      bloc were everywhere, making people tremble with fear.
      <P>
      <CENTER>******************</CENTER>
      <P><B>Conclusion</B>
      <P>Due to the CCP=92s information blockade, we have no way of =
knowing=20
      exactly how many people have died from the various movements of=20
      persecution that occurred during its rule. Over 50 million people =
died in=20
      the movements listed above alone. In addition, the CCP also killed =
people=20
      of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, Tibet, Inner Mongolia, Yunnan =
and other=20
      places; information on these incidents is difficult to unearth.
      <P>Besides those who have died, we have no way of knowing how many =
people=20
      became disabled, mentally ill, enraged, depressed, or frightened =
to death=20
      through the persecution they suffered. Every single death is a =
tragedy=20
      that leaves deep scars on the souls of the victims=92 family =
members.=20
      <P>As the Japan-based <I>Yomiuri News</I> once reported, the =
Chinese=20
      central government=92s survey of all 29 provinces and =
direct-administrated=20
      cities at that time [27] showed that about 600 million people were =
direct=20
      victims or negatively affected by the Cultural Revolution, =
comprising=20
      roughly half of China=92s population.
      <P>Stalin once said, =93The death of one man is a tragedy. The =
death of one=20
      million is a statistic.=94 When told that many people starved to =
death in=20
      Sichuan province, Li Jingquan, the former Sichuan Province =
Communist Party=20
      Secretary, remarked, =93Which dynasty didn=92t have people die?=94 =
Mao Zedong=20
      said that =93Casualties are inevitable for any struggle. Death =
happens=20
      often.=94 This is the atheist communists=92 view on life. That=92s =
why 20=20
      million people died as a result of persecution during Stalin=92s =
regime, 10=20
      percent of the population of the former USSR. The CCP has killed =
at least=20
      80 million people in various persecutions, also roughly 10 percent =
of the=20
      nation=92s population. The Khmer Rouge killed two million people, =
or=20
      one-quarter of Cambodia=92s population at that time. In North =
Korea, the=20
      death toll from famine is over one million. These are all bloody =
debts=20
      owed by the communist parties.
      <P>Evil cults sacrifice people and use their blood to worship evil =

      specters. Since its beginnings, the communist party has continued =
to kill=20
      people=97when it couldn=92t kill those outside the Party, it would =
even kill=20
      its own people=97to commemorate its =93class struggles,=94 =
=93inter-party=20
      struggles,=94 and other fallacies. It even put its own party =
general=20
      secretary, chief of the military, generals, ministers and others =
on the=20
      sacrificial altar of its evil cult.<BR><BR>Many think we should =
give the=20
      CCP time to reform itself, saying that it is quite restrained in =
its=20
      killings now. First of all, killing one person still makes one a =
murderer.=20
      From a wider perspective, because killing is one method for the =
CCP to=20
      govern its terror-based regime, the CCP kills as few or as many as =

      necessary to maintain power. The CCP=92s actions are =
unpredictable. When=20
      people lack a strong sense of fear, the CCP could kill more to =
increase=20
      their sense of terror; when people are already fearful, killing a =
few=20
      could maintain the sense of terror; when people can=92t control =
their fear,=20
      announcing its intention to kill, with no need to really kill =
people,=20
      would be enough for the CCP to maintain terror. After having =
experienced=20
      countless political killing movements, people have formed a =
conditioned=20
      reflex response to the CCP=92s terror, and there is no need to =
even mention=20
      killing. Even the propaganda machine=92s use of mass criticism is =
enough to=20
      bring back people=92s memories of terror.=20
      <P>Whenever people=92s sense of terror changes, the CCP will =
adjust the=20
      intensity of its killing. The number killed in and of itself is =
not the=20
      goal; the key is the consistency in its killings. The CCP has not =
become=20
      gentler and neither has it let go of its butcher=92s knife. It is =
the people=20
      who have become more obedient. Once the people stand up to request =

      something that goes beyond the tolerance of the CCP, the CCP will =
not=20
      hesitate to kill.
      <P>Out of the need to maintain terror, random killing gives the =
maximum=20
      result to achieve this goal. In various large-scale historic =
movements,=20
      the identity, crime, and sentencing standard for victims were kept =

      intentionally vague. To avoid being killed themselves, people =
would often=20
      restrict their speech and actions to =93safe=94 levels. These =
restrictions=20
      even exceeded those that the CCP themselves placed on people. =
That=92s why=20
      in every movement, people tend to act =93rather leftist than =
rightist,=94=20
      following the will of the government, and participate in the =
movements at=20
      the local level. Because every level of government officials =
wanted to=20
      expand the movement to ensure their own safety, the lower the =
level, the=20
      crueler the campaign became. Such society-wide voluntary =
intensification=20
      of terror stems from the CCP=92s random killings.
      <P>In its long history of killing, the CCP has metamorphosed =
itself into a=20
      depraved serial killer. Through killing, it satisfies its =
perverted sense=20
      of the ultimate power of deciding people=92s life and death. =
Through=20
      killing, it eases its own innermost fear. Through killing, it =
suppresses=20
      social unrest and dissatisfaction caused by its earlier murders. =
Today,=20
      the compounded bloody debts of the CCP have made a benevolent =
solution=20
      impossible. It can only rely on intense pressure and totalitarian =
rule to=20
      maintain its existence until its final moment. Despite =
occasionally=20
      disguising itself through redressing its murder victims, the =
CCP=92s=20
      bloodthirsty nature has never changed. It will be even less likely =
