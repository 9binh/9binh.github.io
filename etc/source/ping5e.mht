      <P><B>Foreword</B>
      <P>Ms. Zhang Fuzhen, about 38 years old, was an employee of Xianhe =
Park,=20
      Pingdu City, Shandong Province, China. She went to Beijing to =
appeal for=20
      Falun Gong in November 2000 and was later abducted by the =
authorities.=20
      According to inside information, the police tortured and =
humiliated Zhang=20
      Fuzhen, stripping her naked and completely removing her hair. They =
tied=20
      her to a bed with her four limbs stretched out, and she therefore =
was=20
      forced to relieve herself on the bed. Later, the police gave her =
an=20
      injection of some unknown poisonous drug. After the injection, =
Zhang was=20
      in so much pain that she nearly went insane. She struggled in =
great pain=20
      on the bed until she died. The whole process was witnessed by the =
local=20
      officials of the 610 Office (from a May 31, 2004 report on the =
Minghui=20
      website).
      <P>Ms. Yang Lirong, 34, was from Beimen Street, Dingzhou City, =
Baoding=20
      Prefecture, Hebei Province. Her family was often harassed and =
intimidated=20
      by the police because she practiced Falun Gong. On February 8, =
2002, after=20
      a nighttime police raid, Ms. Yang=92s husband, a vehicle operator =
in the=20
      Bureau of Standards &amp; Meteorology, was traumatized and afraid =
of=20
      losing his job. He failed to withstand the tremendous pressure the =

      authorities exerted on him. Early the next morning, taking =
advantage of=20
      the time when their elderly parents had stepped out of the house, =
he=20
      strangled his wife. Yang Lirong died tragically, leaving a =
10-year-old son=20
      behind. Soon afterwards, her husband reported the incident to the=20
      authorities, and the police hurried to the scene to conduct an =
autopsy on=20
      Ms. Yang=92s body, which was still warm. They took a lot of organs =
from her=20
      body. When they removed her organs, her body was still radiating =
heat and=20
      she bled constantly. A person from the Dingzhou Public Security =
Bureau=20
      said, =93This is no autopsy of a corpse; it is vivisection!=94 =
(from a=20
      September 22, 2004 report by Minghui Net)=20
      <P>In the Wanjia Forced Labor Camp in Heilongjiang Province, a =
woman who=20
      was about 7 months pregnant was hung up from a beam. Both of her =
hands=20
      were tied with a coarse rope that was hung over a pulley attached =
to the=20
      beam. The stool that supported her was removed, and she was =
suspended in=20
      the air. The beam was 3-4 meters above the ground. One end of the =
rope=20
      went through the pulley, and the other end was held by the prison =
guards.=20
      When the guards pulled on the rope, she would be suspended in the =
air; as=20
      soon as the police let go of the rope, she would quickly fall to =
the=20
      ground. This pregnant woman suffered painful torture like this =
until she=20
      had a miscarriage. Even crueler was that her husband was forced to =
be=20
      present to watch his wife endure the torture (from a November 15, =
2004=20
      report on the Minghui website, an interview with Ms. Wang Yuzhi =
who was=20
      tortured for over 100 days in the Wanjia Forced Labor Camp).
      <P>These startling tragedies occurred in modern-day China. They =
happened=20
      to Falun Gong practitioners, who are being brutally persecuted, =
and they=20
      are just a few of the numerous torture cases that have taken place =
over=20
      the past five years of continuous persecution.
      <P>Since China became =93reformed and open,=94 the CCP has =
endeavored to build=20
      a positive, liberal image in the international community. However, =
the=20
      persecution of Falun Gong over the last five years, which has been =
bloody,=20
      irrational, widespread, vehement and brutal, has enabled the =
international=20
      community to once again witness the true face of the CCP and what =
has=20
      become the biggest disgrace on the human rights record of the CCP. =
While=20
      the general public in China, under the delusion that the CCP has =
been=20
      improving and progressing, used to blame the low morality of the =
police=20
      for the atrocities committed within the Chinese legal system and =
law=20
      enforcement, the brutal, systematic persecution of Falun Gong that =
is=20
      ubiquitous throughout every level of Chinese society has =
completely burst=20
      this illusion. Many people are now pondering how such a bloody and =

      outrageous persecution could have happened in China. While the =
social=20
      order was once again stabilizing after the chaos of the Great =
Cultural=20
      Revolution 20 years ago, why have we entered another similar cycle =
of=20
      nightmares? Why is Falun Gong, which upholds the principle of=20
      =93Truthfulness, Compassion and Tolerance=94 and has been =
promulgated in over=20
      60 countries worldwide, being persecuted only in China, not =
anywhere else=20
      in the world? During this persecution, what kind of relationship =
is there=20
      between Jiang Zemin and the CCP?
      <P>Jiang Zemin lacks both ability and moral integrity. Without a =
finely=20
      tuned, killing-and-lie-driven-machine like the CCP, he would never =
have=20
      been capable of launching this genocide, a genocide that is =
widespread=20
      throughout China and that even penetrates overseas. Similarly, =
under the=20
      international atmosphere of its current open policy and endeavors =
to=20
      connect to the world, the CCP would not have easily gone =
counter-current=20
      if there was not a self-willed dictator like Jiang Zemin who was=20
      determined to have his way. The collusion and resonance between =
Jiang=20
      Zemin and the evil spirit of the CCP have amplified the atrocities =
of the=20
      persecution to an unprecedented level. It is similar to how the =
resonance=20
      between the sound of a mountain climber=92s equipment on =
accumulated snow=20
      can cause an avalanche and bring about disastrous consequences.
      <P>
      <CENTER>******************</CENTER>
      <P><B>I. Similar Origin and History Bring about Common Perception =
of=20
      Crises</B>
      <P>Jiang Zemin was born in 1926, a year of calamity. In the same =
way the=20
      CCP conceals its bloody history of development, Jiang Zemin, in =
front of=20
      the Party and the Chinese people, has also covered up his history =
of being=20
      a traitor to China.
      <P>In the year when Jiang Zemin was 17, the worldwide anti-Fascism =
war was=20
      in full swing. When patriotic youths went one after another to the =

      frontline to fight Japan and save China, Jiang Zemin chose to =
pursue=20
      higher education in 1942 in the Central University established by =
the=20
      puppet regime of Wang Jinwei in Nanjing. As investigations from =
various=20
      sources suggest, the true reason was that Jiang Zemin=92s =
biological father,=20
      Jiang Shijun, was once a high-ranking officer in the anti-China =
propaganda=20
      department of the Japanese army, after Japan occupied Jiangsu =
Province=20
      during its invasion of China. Jiang Shijun was truly a traitor to =
China.
      <P>In terms of betrayal and treachery, Jiang Zemin and the CCP are =
the=20
      same: they are so devoid of feeling and affection for the Chinese =
people=20
      that they dare to recklessly kill innocent people.
      <P>In order to infiltrate the CCP to benefit his own wealth and =
rank after=20
      the CCP won the civil war, Jiang Zemin fabricated the lie that he =
was=20
      adopted and raised by his uncle Jiang Shangqing. His uncle had =
joined the=20
      CCP at an early age and was later shot dead by bandits. Because of =
his=20
      fabricated family history, he was able to be promoted from a low =
ranking=20
      official to Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Electronic Industry =
in only=20
      a few years. Jiang=92s promotion was not due to his ability, but =
to his=20
      personal connections and favors. In his tenure as the CCP =
Secretary of the=20
      City of Shanghai, Jiang Zemin spared no effort in currying favor =
with CCP=20
      magnates like Li Xiannian and Chen Yun who came to Shanghai every =
year for=20
      the Spring Festival. Even as the Party Secretary of Shanghai City, =
he once=20
      stood and waited in the deep snow for several hours in order to =
personally=20
      deliver a birthday cake to Li Xiannian.=20
      <P>The =93June 4=94 massacre of 1989 was another turning point in =
Jiang=20
      Zemin=92s life. He became the General Secretary of the CCP through =
closing=20
      down a liberal newspaper, the <I>World Economic Herald</I>, =
putting the=20
      leader of the People=92s Congress, Wan Li, under house arrest, and =

      supporting the =93June 4=94 crackdown. Even before the massacre =
took place,=20
      Jiang Zemin had delivered a secret letter to Deng Xiaoping, =
requesting=20
      that =93resolute measures=94 be taken against the students; =
otherwise =93both=20
      the nation and the Party would be subjugated.=94 Over the past 15 =
years,=20
      Jiang has conducted wanton suppression and killing of all =
dissidents and=20
      groups who hold independent beliefs, in the name of =93stability =
as the=20
      overriding priority.=94
      <P>Since both Russia and China started to prospect the border in =
1991,=20
      Jiang Zemin has fully acknowledged the invasion of China by the =
Tsar and=20
      the former Soviet Union, and completely accepted all the unequal =
treaties=20
      between Russia and China since the Aigun Treaty. Chinese lands =
covering=20
      over one million square kilometers have thus been permanently =
forfeited by=20
      his hands.
      <P>With Jiang Zemin=92s personal history, pretending to be the =
orphan of a=20
      CCP martyr while in fact he was the eldest son of a Chinese =
traitor, he=20
      personally followed the example of deceit of the CCP; with his =
support of=20
      the =93June 4=94 massacre and suppression of democratic movements =
and=20
      religious beliefs, he personally copied the CCP=92s practice of =
killing; as=20
      the CCP used to be under the Soviet Union=92s command as a Far =
East branch=20
      of the Communist International and now that Jiang Zemin gives out =
land for=20
      free, he likewise followed the practice of betrayal, so =
characteristic of=20
      the CCP.=20
      <P>Jiang Zemin and the CCP share similar, disgraceful origins and =
history.=20
      Because of this, both share an acute sense of insecurity regarding =
their=20
      power.=20
      <P>
      <CENTER>******************</CENTER>
      <P><B>II. Both Jiang Zemin and the CCP Equally Fear "Truthfulness, =

      Compassion and Tolerance"</B>
      <P>The history of the international communist movements was =
written with=20
      the blood of hundreds of millions of people. Nearly every =
communist=20
      country went through a process similar to the =
counter-revolutionary=20
      suppression by Stalin in the former Soviet Union. Millions or even =
tens of=20
      millions of innocent people were slaughtered. In the 1990s, the =
former=20
      Soviet Union dissolved and Eastern Europe went through drastic =
changes.=20
      The Communist Bloc lost more than half of its territory overnight. =
The CCP=20
      learned from this lesson and realized that stopping suppression =
and=20
      allowing the right to free speech was the equivalent to seeking =
its own=20
      doom. If people were allowed to freely express themselves, how =
could the=20
      CCP cover up its bloody atrocities? How could it justify its =
deceptive=20
      ideology? If suppression was stopped and people were free of =
threats and=20
      fears, wouldn=92t they dare to choose a lifestyle and a belief =
other than=20
      communism? Then, how would the Communist Party maintain the social =
basis=20
      essential to its survival?
      <P>The CCP remains essentially the same regardless of any surface =
changes=20
      it might have made. After the =93June 4=94 massacre, Jiang Zemin =
cried out to=20
      =93eliminate any unstable factors in their embryonic stage.=94 He =
concluded=20
      that he would never give up the lies even as he lied to the =
public, and he=20
      would continue to suppress the people until they were completely=20
      immobilized.=20
      <P>It was during this period that Falun Gong was introduced in =
China. At=20
      first, Falun Gong was regarded by many as a type of qigong with an =

      especially powerful effect of keeping people healthy and fit. =
Later,=20
      people gradually realized that the essence of Falun Gong was not =
its five=20
      easy sets of exercises. Instead, it was to instruct people to =
become=20
      better persons based upon the principles of "Truthfulness, =
Compassion and=20
      Tolerance."=20
      <P><B>Falun Gong Teaches "Truthfulness, Compassion and Tolerance"; =
the=20
      Communist Party Brews "falsehood, hatred and struggle"</B>
      <P>Falun Gong promotes =93Truthfulness,=94 including only telling =
the truth=20
      and doing truthful things. The CCP has been relying on lies to =
brainwash=20
      people. If everyone began telling the truth, the public would =
learn that=20
      the CCP grew by ingratiating itself with the Soviet Union, =
murdering,=20
      kidnapping, taking flight when convenient, planting opium, =
usurping the=20
      cause of fighting against Japan, and so on. The CCP once claimed, =
=93Nothing=20
      significant can be accomplished without lying.=94 After the CCP =
seized=20
      power, it initiated successive political movements and incurred =
countless=20
      bloody debts. Promoting truthfulness would thus spell certain doom =
to the=20
      CCP.
      <P>Falun Gong promotes =93Compassion,=94 including considering =
others first=20
      and being kind to others in all circumstances. The CCP has always=20
      advocated =93brutal struggles and merciless crackdown.=94 The =
CCP's model=20
      hero, Lei Feng, once said, =93We should treat our enemies =
mercilessly and as=20
      cold as the severe winter.=94 Actually, the CCP not only treated =
their=20
      enemies like that, they haven=92t treated their own people any =
better. The=20
      founders of the Communist Party, the supreme commanders and =
marshals, and=20
      even the chairman of the country were all mercilessly =
interrogated,=20
      brutally beaten and miserably tortured by their own party. The =
slaughter=20
      of the so-called =93enemies=94 was so brutal it could make one=92s =
hair stand on=20
      end. If =93compassion=94 had dominated the society, the mass =
movements based=20
      upon =93vice,=94 as initiated by the Communist Party, would have =
never been=20
      able to take place.
      <P>The book "<I>The Communist Manifesto</I>" states that the =
history of=20
      every society is a history class struggle. This represents the =
Communist=20
      Party's concept of history and the world. Falun Gong, on the other =
hand,=20
      promotes searching inside oneself for one=92s own shortcomings in =
the face=20
      of conflict. This introspective and self-restrained outlook =
completely=20
      opposes the CCP=92s philosophy of struggle and attack.
      <P>Struggle has been the major means for the Communist Party to =
gain=20
      political power and survive. The Communist Party periodically =
initiated=20
      political movements to suppress certain groups of people in order =
to=20
      recharge itself and =93revive its revolutionary fighting spirit." =
The=20
      process was repeated with violence and lies, in order to =
strengthen and=20
      renew people=92s fear, so as to maintain its power.
      <P>From the ideological point of view, the philosophy that the =
Communist=20
      Party has relied on for its survival is completely opposite to =
what Falun=20
      Gong teaches.
      <P><B>People with Righteous Beliefs Are Fearless, While the CCP =
Relies on=20
      People=92s Fear to Maintain Its Political Power</B>
      <P>People who understand truth are fearless. Christianity was =
persecuted=20
      for nearly 300 years. Numerous Christians were beheaded, burned to =
death=20
      or drowned, or even fed to lions and tigers, but the Christians =
did not=20
      give up their belief. When Buddhism experienced the Dharma =
tribulation in=20
      history, Buddhists also behaved faithfully in a similar manner.=20
      <P>One important goal of the atheists=92 propaganda is to make =
people=20
      believe that there is no heaven or hell and that there is no =
karmic=20
      retribution, so that people would no longer be restrained by their =

      conscience. Instead, they would focus on wealth and comfort as =
being the=20
      reality of this world. The weaknesses in human nature can then be=20
      manipulated, and the Communist Party can use intimidation and =
temptation=20
      to fully control people. People who have a conviction of belief =
are able=20
      to see through life and death. They are disillusioned by the =
secular=20
      world. They take the temptations of the earthly world and the =
threats to=20
      their lives lightly, thus rendering the Communist Party rather =
feeble in=20
      any efforts to manipulate them.
      <P><B>The high Moral Standards of Falun Gong Embarrass the CCP</B>
      <P>After the =93June 4=94 event in 1989 (<I>the Tiananmen Square=20
      massacre</I>), the ideology of the CCP has gone completely =
bankrupt. In=20
      August 1991, the Communist Party of the former Soviet Union =
collapsed,=20
      followed by drastic changes in Eastern Europe. This brought =
enormous fear=20
      and pressure to the CCP. The legitimacy of its rule and the =
prospect of=20
      its survival faced unprecedented challenges as it encountered =
great crises=20
      both at home and abroad. At that time, the CCP was no longer able =
to unite=20
      its members with its original doctrines of Marxism, Leninism and =
Maoism.=20
      Instead, it turned to total corruption in exchange for party =
members=92=20
      loyalty. In other words, whoever followed the Party would be =
allowed to=20
      gain personal benefits through corruption and embezzlement, an =
advantage=20
      impossible to non-party members. Especially after Deng =
Xiaoping=92s tour of=20
      south China in 1992, government officials=92 profiteering and =
corruption in=20
      real estate and the stock market have run wild in China. =
Prostitution and=20
      black-market trading are everywhere. Pornography, gambling and =
drugs have=20
      become rampant all over China. Although it may not be fair to say =
that=20
      there was not a single good person in the Communist Party, the =
general=20
      public has long ago lost confidence in the Party=92s =
anti-corruption=20
      efforts, and holds that more than half of the middle or high =
ranking=20
      government officials have already become corrupt.
      <P>At the same time, the high moral standard demonstrated by Falun =
Gong=20
      practitioners, who cultivate =93Truthfulness, Compassion, and =
Tolerance,=94=20
      resonated with kindness in the hearts of the public. Hundreds of =
millions=20
      of people were attracted to Falun Gong and started the practice. =
Falun=20
      Gong is a mirror of morality which by its very nature reveals all =
the=20
      unrighteousness of the CCP.
      <P><B>The CCP was Extremely Jealous of the Way Falun Gong Was =
Spread and=20
      Managed</B>
      <P>The unique way Falun Gong propagates is person to person and =
heart to=20
      heart. Falun Gong has a loose management structure, and anyone can =
come=20
      and go freely as he wishes. It is very different from the strict=20
      organization of the CCP. Despite the strict organization, the =
political=20
      study and group activities conducted weekly or more frequently in =
the CCP=20
      branches existed only in name. Few Party members agreed on the =
Party=20
      ideology. On the contrary, Falun Gong students consciously =
followed the=20
      principles of =93Truthfulness, Compassion and Tolerance=94. =
Because of the=20
      powerful effect of Falun Gong on improving people=92s health in =
both body=20
      and mind, the number of people who practiced Falun Gong grew=20
      exponentially. Students voluntarily studied Mr. Li Hongzhi=92s =
series of=20
      books and promoted Falun Gong at their own expense. In a short =
period of=20
      seven years, the number of Falun Gong students grew from none to =
one=20
      hundred million. When they practiced the exercises in the morning, =
Falun=20
      Gong exercise music could be heard in almost every park in China.
      <P>The Communist Party said that Falun Gong =93contends=94 for the =
masses with=20
      the CCP and that it was a "religion". In fact, what Falun Gong =
brings to=20
      people is a culture. It is an ancestral culture that the Chinese =
people=20
      had lost long ago. It was the root of Chinese traditions. Jiang =
Zemin and=20
      the Communist Party feared Falun Gong, because once this =
traditional=20
      morality was accepted by the public, nothing could prevent it from =

      spreading rapidly. Such an inborn Chinese tradition was forcibly =
shut off=20
      and tampered with by the Communist Party for decades. It would be =
a=20
      historical choice to return to tradition. It would be the path of =
return=20
      chosen by the vast majority of people after tribulations and =
misery. When=20
      given such a choice, people distinguish between right and wrong =
and are=20
      likely to leave wickedness behind. This would certainly be a =
fundamental=20
      denial and abandonment of what the Communist Party has promoted. =
This was=20
      like striking at the mortal weakness of the CCP. When the number =
of people=20
      who practiced Falun Gong exceeded that of the Communist Party =
members, you=20
      could imagine the deep fear and jealousy of the CCP.
      <P>In China, the CCP exerts total control over every part of =
society. In=20
      the countryside, there are Communist Party branches in every =
single=20
      village. In urban areas, branch offices of the CCP are found in =
every=20
      administrative office in the neighborhood. In the army, government =
and=20
      enterprises, the Party branches reach to the very roots. Absolute =
monopoly=20
      and exclusive manipulation are essential measures that the CCP =
takes to=20
      maintain its regime. In the "Constitution", it is euphemistically =
termed=20
      as =93persisting in the leadership of the Party.=94 Falun Gong =
students were=20
      obviously more inclined to take "Truthfulness, Compassion and =
Tolerance=94=20
      as their principles. The CCP saw this as nothing short of =
=93denying the=20
      leadership of the Party=94, which was absolutely unacceptable to =
it.=20
      <P><B>The Communist Party Considers Falun Gong=92s Theism a Threat =
to the=20
      Legality of the Communist Regime</B>
      <P>A true theistic belief is bound to be a significant challenge =
to the=20
      Communist Party. Because the legitimacy of the Communist regime =
was based=20
      upon the so-called =93historic materialism=94 and the wish to =
build a =93heaven=20
      on earth,=94 it could only rely on the leadership of the =
=93vanguard in the=20
      world=94, namely, the Communist Party. Meanwhile, the practice of =
atheism=20
      enabled the Communist Party to freely interpret what is virtuous, =
what is=20
      good or bad. As a result, there has been virtually no morality, =
good or=20
      bad to speak of. All that people have to remember is that the =
Party is=20
      always =93great, glorious and right.=94
      <P>However, theism gives people an unchanging standard for good =
and bad.=20
      Falun Gong students evaluate right or wrong based on =
=93Truthfulness,=20
      Compassion and Tolerance.=94 This obviously hinders the CCP=92s =

      efforts to =93unify people=92s thinking.=94<BR><BR>If we continue =
with our=20
      analysis, there are still many other reasons. However, any one of =
the=20
      above five reasons is fatal to the CCP. Actually, Jiang Zemin =
suppresses=20
      Falun Gong for the same reasons. Jiang Zemin started his career by =
lying=20
      about his past, so of course he is afraid of =93truth.=94 Through =
suppressing=20
      people, he quickly became successful and powerful, so of course he =

      dislikes =93compassion.=94 He maintained his power through =
political struggles=20
      inside the Party, so of course he dislikes =93tolerance.=94
      <P>From a small incident we can tell how extremely petty and =
jealous Jiang=20
      Zemin is. The Museum of Hemudu Cultural Ruins (1) in Yuyao County =
(now=20
      reclassified to a City), Zhejiang Province is a major historical =
and=20
      cultural site under state conservation. Originally, it was Qiao =
Shi (2)=20
      who wrote the signature inscription for the Museum of Hemudu =
Cultural=20
      Ruins. In September 1992, Jiang Zemin saw Qiao Shi=92s inscription =
when he=20
      visited the museum and his face turned dark and gloomy. The =
accompanying=20
      personnel were very nervous, as they knew that Jiang could not =
stand Qiao=20
      Shi and that Jiang liked to show off so much that he would wrote =
an=20
      inscription wherever he went, even when he went to visit the =
Traffic=20
      Police Branch Division, Public Security Bureau in Jinan City and =
the=20
      Zhengzhou City=92s Retired Engineers Association. The museum staff =
dared not=20
      slight the petty Jiang Zemin. Consequently, in May 1993, under the =
excuse=20
      of renovation, the museum replaced Qiao Shi=92s inscription with =
one of=20
      Jiang=92s before the re-opening.
      <P>Mao Zedong is said to have =93four volumes of profound and =
powerful=20
      writing=94, whereas the =93Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping=94 has =
a =93cat theory=94=20
      with the flavor of practical ideology. Jiang Zemin exhausted his =
brain but=20
      could only came up with three sentences (although it was said that =
the=20
      original author was Wang Huning), yet he claimed to have come up =
with=20
      =93three chapters.=94 It was published into a book and promoted by =
the CCP=20
      through level after level of government organizations, yet it was =
only=20
      sold because people were forced to buy it. Nevertheless, the Party =
members=20
      still didn=92t respect Jiang Zemin even a little bit. They spread =
gossip=20
      about his affair with a singer and the embarrassing episodes of =
his=20
      singing =93O Sole Mio=94 when he traveled abroad and combing his =
hair in front=20
      of the King of Spain. When the founder of Falun Gong, Mr. Li =
Hongzhi, who=20
      was born an ordinary civilian, gave a lecture, the lecture hall =
would be=20
      filled with professors, experts and Chinese students studying =
abroad. Many=20
      people with doctorate or masters degrees flew thousands of miles =
to listen=20
      to his lectures. When Mr. Li lectured eloquently on the stage for =
several=20
      hours, he did it without using any notes. Afterwards, the lecture =
could be=20
      transcribed on paper and made into a book to be published. All =
these=20
      things were unbearable to Jiang Zemin, who is vain, jealous and =
petty.
      <P>Jiang Zemin lives an extremely lavish, lustful and corrupt =
life. He=20
      spent nine hundred million yuan (over <I>$US 110 million</I>) to =
buy a=20
      luxurious plane for his use. Jiang often drew money from public =
funds, by=20
      the tens of billions, for his son to do business. He used nepotism =
to=20
      promote his relatives and minions to high-ranking posts above the=20
      ministerial level, and he resorted to desperate and extreme =
measures in=20
      covering up for his cronies=92 corruption and crimes. For all =
these reasons,=20
      Jiang is afraid of Falun Gong=92s moral authority, and even more =
is he=20
      afraid that the topics of heaven, hell, and the principle of good =
and bad=20
      being rewarded accordingly, as addressed by Falun Gong, are indeed =
real.
      <P>Although Jiang held the greatest power in the CCP in his hands, =
since=20
      he lacked political achievement and talent, he often worried that =
he would=20
      be forced out of the power amidst the CCP=92s ruthless power =
struggles. He=20
      is very sensitive about his status as the =93core=94 of the power. =
In order to=20
      eliminate dissension, he plotted underhanded schemes to get rid of =
his=20
      political enemies Yang Shangkun and his brother Yang Baibing. In =
15th=20
      National Congress of the Communist Party Committee (CPC) in 1997 =
and the=20
      16th National Congress of the CPC in 2002, Jiang forced his =
opponents to=20
      leave their posts. Yet, he, on the other hand, ignored the =
relevant=20
      regulations and clung dearly to <I>his</I> post.
      <P>One day after the June 4th Massacre in 1989, the new Secretary =
General=20
      of the CCP Jiang Zemin held a press conference for both domestic =
and=20
      foreign reporters. A French reporter asked about the story of a =
female=20
      college student who, because of her involvement in the June 4th =
incident,=20
      was transferred to a farm in Sichuan Province to carry bricks from =
one=20
      place to another and was subsequently raped repeatedly by the =
local=20
      peasants. Jiang replied, =93I don=92t know if what you said is =
true or not,=20
      but that woman is a hoodlum. Even if it is true, she deserved =
it.=94 During=20
      the Great Cultural Revolution, Zhang Zhixin (3) was subjected to =
gang rape=20
      and her throat was cut (to prevent her from revealing the truth) =
when she=20
      was detained in prison. Jiang Zemin would probably also think that =
she=20
      deserved it. We can easily see Jiang Zemin=92s thug-like deviant =
mentality=20
      and cruelty.
      <P>In summary, Jiang Zemin=92s dark mentality, hunger for =
dictatorial power,=20
      cruelty and fear of =93Truth-Compassion-Tolerance=94 are the =
reasons behind=20
      his irrationally launching the campaign to suppress Falun Gong. =
This is=20
      highly consistent with the way CCP operates.=20
      <P>
      <CENTER>******************</CENTER>
      <P><B>III. Jiang Zemin and the CCP Colluded with Each Other</B>
      <P>Jiang Zemin is known for showing off and employing political =
trickery.=20
      His incompetence and ignorance are well-known. Although he =
wholeheartedly=20
      intended to =93exterminate=94 Falun Gong out of his personal =
spite, he was=20
      incapable of doing much, as Falun Gong is rooted in traditional =
Chinese=20
      culture and has become so popular that it has gained a broad =
social basis.=20
      However, the mechanisms of tyranny employed by the CCP were in =
full=20
      operation, and it also intended to uproot Falun Gong. Jiang Zemin =
took=20
      advantage of his position as the General Secretary of the CCP and=20
      personally launched the crackdown against Falun Gong. The effect =
of=20
      collusion and resonance between Jiang Zemin and the CCP was like =
an=20
      avalanche caused by the shouts of a mountain climber.
      <P>Before Jiang officially issued orders for the crackdown against =
Falun=20
      Gong, the CCP had already begun its suppression, monitoring, =
investigation=20
      and fabrications for framing accusations against Falun Gong. The =
CCP=92s=20
      corrupt spirit instinctively felt threatened by=20
      =93Truthfulness-Compassion-Tolerance=94, not to mention the =
unprecedented=20
      rapid growth of the practice. Undercover public security personnel =
in the=20
      CCP infiltrated Falun Gong, but they failed to discover any =
faults, and=20
      some even began to practice Falun Gong in earnest. In 1996, =
<I>Guangming=20
      Daily</I> violated the =93Three Restrictions," a state policy =
regarding=20
      qigong (i.e. that the state does not "advocate, promote or =
intervene in"=20
      qigong activities), publishing an article denouncing Falun Gong, =
claiming=20
      that it was political. After that, politicians with backgrounds in =
public=20
      security or labeled as =93scientists=94 continually harassed Falun =
Gong. At=20
      the beginning of 1997, Luo Gan, Secretary of the Political and =
Judiciary=20
      Committee of the Central Committee of CCP took advantage of his =
power and=20
      ordered the Public Security Bureau to carry out a nationwide =
investigation=20
      of Falun Gong with the intention of finding charges to justify a =
ban on=20
      Falun Gong. After it was reported from around the country that "no =

      evidence was found so far", Luo Gan issued a circular - No. 555 -=20
      "Notification Regarding Starting an Investigation of Falun Gong=94 =
through=20
      the First Division of the Public Security Bureau (also called the=20
      Political Security Bureau). He first charged Falun Gong with being =
an=20
      =93evil cult=94 and then ordered the police departments across the =
country to=20
      systematically investigate Falun Gong, using undercover personnel =
to=20
      collect evidence. The investigation found no evidence to support =
his=20
      accusation.
      <P>Before the CCP could begin to crack down on Falun Gong, it =
needed the=20
      right person to operate the mechanisms for suppression. How the =
head of=20
      CCP handled the issue was crucial. As an individual, the Chinese =
Communist=20
      Party chief could possess both goodness and evil. If he chose to =
follow=20
      his good side, then he could temporarily restrain the irrational =
attacks=20
      by the CCP; otherwise, the evil nature of the CCP would be fully=20
      manifested.=20
      <P>During the pro-democracy student movement in 1989, Zhao Ziyang, =
then=20
      General Secretary of the CCP Central Committee, had no intention =
of=20
      suppressing the students. It was the eight party elders =
controlling the=20
      CCP who insisted on suppressing the students. Deng Xiaoping said =
at that=20
      time, =93(We would) kill 200,000 people in exchange for 20 years =
of=20
      stability.=94 The so-called =9320 years of stability=94 actually =
meant 20 years=20
      of the CCP regime. This idea conformed to the fundamental goal of =
the=20

      <P>Regarding the Falun Gong issue, out of the seven members of the =

      Standing Committee of Political Bureau of the CCP Central =
Committee, Jiang=20
      Zemin was the only one who insisted on the suppression. The excuse =
Jiang=20
      provided was that it was related to =93the survival of the Party =
and the=20
      country=94, and this touched the most sensitive nerve of the CCP.=20
      <P>Jiang Zemin=92s attempt to maintain his personal power and the =

      this point.
      <P>On the evening of July 19, 1999, Jiang Zemin chaired a =
conference of=20
      the CCP=92s highest-ranking officials. He overrode the law with =
his=20
      political power, personally =93unified=94 the understanding (of =
all seven=20
      members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau), and =
personally=20
      decided to launch a massive crackdown on Falun Gong. He banned =
Falun Gong=20
      in the name of the Chinese government and deceived the public. The =
CCP,=20
      China=92s government, and the violent mechanisms employed by the =
CCP were=20
      used to their full extent in an overwhelming suppression of =
millions of=20
      innocent Falun Gong students.
      <P>If the General Secretary of the CCP at that time had been =
someone other=20
      than Jiang Zemin, the suppression of Falun Gong would not have =
taken=20
      place. In that respect, we can say that the CCP used Jiang Zemin.
      <P>On the other hand, if the CCP had not incurred so many bloody =
debts=20
      with its immoral and savage nature, it would not have considered =
Falun=20

      <P>Most despicable was the so-called =93self-immolation=94 =
incident staged in=20
      January 2001, which was reported worldwide at unprecedented speed =
via=20
      Xinhua News Agency. The incident has since been determined by =
numerous=20
      international organizations, including the International Education =
and=20
      Development Agency of the United Nations, to have been staged. =
During=20
      questioning, a member of the TV crew admitted that some of the =
footage=20
      shown on CCTV was in fact shot afterwards. One can=92t help but =

      these =93Falun Gong disciples facing death unflinchingly=94 could =
be so=20
      cooperative with the CCP authorities.
      <P>No lies can survive the light of day. While spinning out rumors =
and=20
      fabricating lies, the CCP also has done everything in its power to =
block=20
      the flow of information. It mercilessly suppressed any overseas =
reports on=20
      Falun Gong activities, as well as any reasonable defense by Falun =
Gong=20
      students. All Falun Gong books and other documents were destroyed =
without=20

foreign=20
      media attempts to interview Falun Gong students in China, =
including=20
      expelling journalists from China, pressuring foreign news media, =
or=20

      <P>As for the Falun Gong students in China who have tried to =
transmit=20
      overseas the facts about Falun Gong and materials documenting =
inhumane=20
      suppression by the authorities, the CCP also has adopted extreme =
measures=20
      in suppressing them. At Tsinghua University alone, over a dozen =
teachers=20
      and students were given long prison terms for this reason. After =
the=20
      acknowledgment of the rape while in detention of Ms. Wei Xingyan, =
a Falun=20
      Gong practitioner and graduate student at Chongqing University, =
seven=20
      Falun Gong students in Chongqing were charged with the crime and =
given=20
      long prison terms.
      <P><B>Imposing Fines and Ransacking Homes without due Process</B>
      <P>The entire state apparatus of the CCP has carried out a policy =
of=20
      =93bankrupting [Falun Gong disciples] financially.=94 In the more =
than five=20
      years since the start of the suppression, hundreds of thousands of =
Falun=20
      Gong practitioners have been fined amounts ranging from thousands =
of yuan=20
      to tens of thousands of yuan in efforts to intimidate them and =
cause them=20
      severe financial loss. With no justification whatsoever, local=20
      governments, work units, police stations and public security =
departments=20
      have arbitrarily imposed these fines. Those who are forced to pay =
the=20
      fines are not issued any receipts or referred to any articles of =
law for=20
      explanation. There is no due process.
      <P>Ransacking homes is another form of robbery inflicted on Falun =
Gong=20
      practitioners. Those who have held firm in their belief have had =
to face=20
      unwarranted searches and the police ransacking their residence at =
any=20
      moment. Their cash and other valuables have been confiscated =
without=20
      justification. In the countryside, even grain and other food =
products have=20
      not been spared. Likewise, none of the items taken away from Falun =
Gong=20
      students have been documented nor any receipts ever issued. =
Usually those=20
      who confiscated student=92s property kept it for themselves.
      <P>At the same time, Falun Gong students have also faced the =
penalty of=20
      being laid off. In the countryside the authorities have threatened =
to=20
      confiscate practitioners=92 land. The CCP has not overlooked the =
elderly who=20
      are retired. Their pension plans have been terminated and the =
government=20
      has evicted them from their residences. Some Falun Dafa students =
in=20
      business have had their properties confiscated and bank accounts =
frozen.
      <P>In carrying out these policies, the CCP took the approach of =
guilt by=20
      association. That is, if there were Falun Gong students found in =
any=20
      particular work unit or state enterprise, the leaders and the =
employees of=20
      these units would not receive bonuses, nor would they get =
promoted. The=20
      goal is to instigate hatred against Falun Gong students in =
society. Family=20
      members and relatives of Falun Gong students also face the threat =
of=20
      dismissal from work, of having their children expelled from =
school, and of=20
      being evicted from their residences. All these measures serve the =
same=20
      purpose: cutting off all possible sources of income for Falun Gong =

      students in order to force them to give up their belief.
      <P><B>Brutal acts of Torture and Arbitrary Killing</B>
      <P>The gruesome policy of =93destroying [Falun Gong disciples] =
physically=94=20
      has been primarily carried out by the police, procuratorate =
(prosecutors)=20
      and the court system in China. Based on statistics gathered by the =
Minghui=20
      website, at least 1,128 Falun Gong students have died from =
persecution=20
      since the persecution began over five years ago. The deaths have =
occurred=20
      in more than 30 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities. =
By=20
      October 1, 2004, the province recording the greatest number of =
deaths was=20
      Heilongjiang, followed by Jilin, Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, =
Sichuan, and=20
      Hubei. The youngest to die was only 10 months old, the oldest 72 =
years=20
      old. Women accounted for 51.3%. Those over 50 accounted for =
38.86%. CPP=20
      officials have admitted privately that the actual number of Falun =
Gong=20
      students who have died from persecution is much higher.
      <P>The brutal tortures used on Falun Gong practitioners are many =
and=20
      varied. Beating, whipping, electric shock torture, freezing, tying =
with=20
      ropes, handcuffing and shackling for extended periods, burning =
with open=20
      flame, lit cigarettes or hot irons, being cuffed and hung up, =
being forced=20
      to stand or kneel down for a long time, being jabbed with bamboo =
sticks,=20
      sexual abuse, and rape are just a handful of examples. In October =
2000,=20
      guards at the Masanjia Forced Labor Camp in Liaoning Province =
stripped the=20
      clothes completely off eighteen women Falun Gong students and =
threw them=20
      into the prison cells for male inmates to rape and abuse at will. =
All=20
      these crimes have been documented in full and are too numerous to =
list.
      <P>Another common form, among many, of inhumane torture is the =
abusive use=20
      of =93psychiatric treatment.=94 Normal, rational, and healthy =
Falun Gong=20
      students have been unlawfully locked up in psychiatric facilities =
and=20
      injected with unknown drugs capable of destroying a person=92s =
central=20
      nervous system. Some students, as a result, have suffered partial =
or=20
      complete paralysis. Some have lost the sight in both eyes or lost =
hearing=20
      in both ears. Some have experienced the destruction of muscles or =
internal=20
      organs. Some have lost part or all of their memory and become =
mentally=20
      retarded. The internal organs of some students have been severely =
injured.=20
      Some have suffered complete mental collapse. Some even died =
because the=20
      drugs injected took effect too quickly.
      <P>Statistics indicate that cases of Falun Gong students being =
persecuted=20
      with =93psychiatric treatment=94 have spread to 23 provinces, =
autonomous=20
      regions and municipalities in China. At least 100 psychiatric =
facilities=20
      at the provincial, city, county or district level have engaged in =
the=20
      persecution. Based on the number and distribution of these cases, =
it is=20
      clear that the abusive use of psychiatric drugs on Falun Gong =
students has=20
      been a well-planned, systematically carried out, top-down policy. =
At least=20
      1,000 Falun Gong students were sent to psychiatric facilities or =
drug=20
      rehabilitation centers against their will. Many of them were =
forcibly=20
      injected or force-fed numerous drugs capable of destroying a =
person=92s=20
      nervous system. These Falun Gong students were also tied with =
ropes and=20

      meeting of the CCP to launch an all-out suppression of Falun Gong =
and set=20
      up the =93Office for Dealing with the Falun Gong Issue=94 in the =
Central=20
      Committee. Since it was established on June 10, it was called the =
=93610=20
      Office.=94 After that, 610 Offices were set up across the country =
at all=20
      levels of government, from the highest to the lowest, to be =

      men for the 610 Office. The 610 Office technically reports to the =
State=20

that is=20
      allowed to exist outside of the established framework of the state =

      Chinese government, free from any legal restriction, regulation or =

to Nazi=20
      Germany=92s Gestapo, with powers far above and beyond the legal =
and=20
      judiciary systems, employing the resources of the country as it =
sees fit.=20
      On July 22, 1999, after Jiang Zemin issued the order to suppress =
Falun=20
      Gong, the Xinhua News Agency released the speeches by people in =
charge of=20
      the CCP Central Organizational Ministry and the CCP Central =
Propaganda=20
      Ministry, giving open support to the persecution of Falun Gong =
launched by=20
      Jiang Zemin. All of these entities cooperated under the CCP=92s =
strict=20
      organization to carry out Jiang Zemin=92s vicious scheme.
      <P>So many cases have proved that neither the public security =
department=20
      nor the procuratorate nor the people=92s court have any power to =
make their=20
      own decisions on any case related to Falun Gong. They have to take =

When it=20
      issued orders to all organs under the system of the Chinese =

      information from inside the Party=92s Public Security Department =

The cost=20
      in wages alone may run into the hundreds of billions of yuan. =
Moreover,=20
      Jiang Zemin spent huge amounts to expand forced labor camps to =

      and encourage greater numbers of people to participate in =
persecuting=20
      Falun Gong. In many areas, the prize for arresting a Falun Gong=20

Masanjia=20
      Forced Labor Camp in Liaoning Province is one of the most evil =
places that=20
