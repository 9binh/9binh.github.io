      Commentaries on the CCP.</A></I>
      <P><BR>According to the book <I>Explaining Simple and Analyzing =
Compound=20
      Characters (Shuowen Jiezi)</I> written by Xu Shen (d. 147 AD), the =

      traditional Chinese character meaning =93party=94 or =93gang=94 =
consists of two=20
      radicals that correspond to =93still or even=94 and =93dark or =
black=94=20
      respectively, connoting the meaning =93still dark.=94 =93Party=94 =
or =93party=20
      member=94 (which can also be interpreted as =93gang=94 or =93gang =
member=94) carries=20
      a derogatory meaning. Confucius said, =93I heard that a noble man =
would not=20
      join a gang (party).=94 In the Analects (<I>Lunyu</I>), =
Confucius=92=20
      interpretation of this character explains that people who help one =
another=20
      conceal their crimes and do bad things are said to be forming a =
gang=20
      (party). It is a synonym for =93gang of scoundrels=94 and is =
associated with=20
      the implication of ganging up for selfish purposes.
      <P>Why did the Communist Party emerge and eventually seize power =
in modern=20
      China? The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has constantly instilled =
into the=20
      Chinese people=92s minds that history has chosen the CCP, that the =
people=20
      have chosen the CCP, and that =93without the CCP there would be no =
new=20
      China.=94
      <P>Did the Chinese people choose the Communist Party of their own=20
      initiative? Or, did the Communist Party force its selfish =
interests and=20
      its views upon the Chinese people? We must find answers from =
history.
      <P>From the late Qing Dynasty to the early years of the Republic =
period=20
      (1911-1949), China experienced tremendous external shocks and =
extensive=20
      attempts at internal reform. Chinese society was in painful =
turmoil. Many=20
      intellectuals and people with lofty ideals wanted to save the =
country and=20
      its people, but in the midst of national crisis and chaos, their =
sense of=20
      anxiety grew, leading first to disappointment and then complete =
despair.=20
      Like people who turn to any available doctor in times of illness, =
they=20
      looked outside China for their solutions. When the British and =
French=20
      styles failed, they switched to the Russian method. Anxious to =
succeed,=20
      they did not hesitate to prescribe the most extreme remedy for the =

      illness, in the hope that China would quickly become strong.
      <P>The May Fourth movement of 1919 was a thorough reflection of =
this=20
      despair. Some people advocated anarchism; others proposed to =
overthrow the=20
      doctrines of Confucius, and still others suggested bringing in =
foreign=20
      culture. In short, they rejected Chinese traditional culture and =
opposed=20
      the Confucian doctrine of the middle way. Eager to take a =
shortcut, they=20
      advocated the destruction of everything traditional. On the one =
hand the=20
      radical members among them did not have a way to serve the =
country, and on=20
      the other hand they believed firmly in their own ideals. They felt =
the=20
      world was hopeless, believing that only by themselves could they =
find the=20
      correct approach to China=92s future development. They were =
passionate for=20
      revolution and violence.
      <P>Different experiences led to different theories, principles and =
paths=20
      among various groups. Eventually a group of people met Communist =
Party=20
      representatives from the Soviet Union. The idea of "using violent=20
      revolution to seize political power," lifted from the theory of=20
      Marxism-Leninism, appealed to their anxious minds and conformed to =
their=20
      desire to save the country and its people. Hence, they introduced=20
      Communism, a completely foreign concept, into China. Altogether 13 =

      representatives attended the first CCP Congress. Later, some of =
them died,=20
      some ran away, some worked for the occupying Japanese force and =
became=20
      traitors, and some quit the CCP to join the Kuomintang (the =
Nationalist=20
      Party, hereafter referred to as KMT). By 1949 when the CCP came to =
power,=20
      only Mao Zedong (also spelled Mao Tse Tung) and Dong Biwu still =
remained=20
      of the original 13 Party members. It is unclear whether the =
founders of=20
      the CCP were aware at the time that the =93deity=94 they had =
introduced from=20
      the Soviet Union was in reality an evil specter, and the remedy =
they=20
      sought for strengthening the nation was actually a deadly poison.
      <P>The All-Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik) (later known as the =

      Communist Party of the Soviet Union), having just won its =
revolution, was=20
      obsessed with ambitions for China. In 1920, the Soviet Union =
established=20
      the Far Eastern Bureau in Siberia, a branch of the Third Communist =

      International, or the Comintern. It was responsible for managing =
the=20
      establishment of a Communist party in China and other countries. =
Soon=20
      after its establishment, the bureau=92s deputy manager Grigori =
Voitinsky=20
      arrived in Beijing and contacted the Communist vanguard Li Dazhao. =
Li=20
      arranged for Voitinsky to meet with another Communist leader, Chen =
Duxiu,=20
      in Shanghai. In August of 1920, Voitinsky, Chen Duxiu, Li Hanjun, =
Shen=20
      Xuanlu, Yu Xiusong, Shi Cuntong and others began to prepare for =
the=20
      establishment of the CCP.
      <P>In June of 1921, Zhang Tailei arrived at Irkutsk in Siberia, =
whereupon=20
      he submitted a proposal to the Far Eastern Bureau proposing to =
establish=20
      the CCP as a branch of the Comintern. On July 23, 1921, under the =
help of=20
      Nikolsky and Maring from the Far East Bureau, the CCP was =
officially=20
      formed.
      <P>The Communist movement was then introduced to China as an =
experiment,=20
      and ever since, the CCP has set itself above all, conquering all =
in its=20
      path, thereby bringing endless catastrophe to China.
      <P>
      <CENTER>******************</CENTER>
      <P><B>I. The CCP Grew by Steadily Accumulating Wickedness</B>
      <P>It is not an easy task to introduce a foreign specter such as =
the=20
      Communist Party, one that is totally incompatible with the Chinese =

      tradition, into China, a country with a history of 5,000 years of=20
      civilization. Throughout the history of the CCP, from its =
establishment to=20
      its gaining and maintaining political power, it has gradually =
become=20
      increasingly wicked. In this development the CCP has made use of =
the nine=20
      inherited character traits that the Communist specter brought with =
it:=20
      evil, deceit, incitement, unleashing the scum of society, =
espionage,=20
      robbery, fighting, elimination, and control. Responding to =
continuous=20
      crises, the CCP has further consolidated and strengthened the =
means and=20
      extent to which these malignant characteristics have been playing =
out.
      <P><B>First Inherited Trait: Evil=97Putting on the Evil Form of=20
      Marxism-Leninism</B>
      <P>Marxism initially attracted the Chinese Communists with its =
declaration=20
      to =93use violent revolution to destroy the old state apparatus =
and to=20
      establish a proletariat dictatorship.=94 This is precisely the =
root of evil=20
      in Marxism and Leninism.
      <P>Marxist materialism is predicated on the narrow economic =
concepts of=20
      forces of production, production relations, and surplus value. =
During the=20
      early, underdeveloped stages of capitalism, Marx made a =
shortsighted=20
      prediction that capitalism would die and the proletariat would =
win, which=20
      has now been proven wrong. Marxist-Leninist violent revolution and =

      proletarian dictatorship promote power-politics and proletarian=20
      domination. The Communist Manifesto related the Communist Party's=20
      historical and philosophical basis to class conflict and struggle. =
The=20
      proletariat broke free from traditional morals and social =
relations for=20
      the sake of seizing power. Upon their first appearance, the =
doctrines of=20
      Communism are set in opposition to all tradition.
      <P>Human nature universally repels violence. Violence makes people =

      ruthless and tyrannical. Thus, in all places and all times =
humanity has=20
      fundamentally rejected the premises of the Communist Party=92s =
theory of=20
      violence, a theory that has no antecedent in any former systems of =

      thought, philosophy, or tradition. The Communist system of terror =
fell=20
      upon the earth as if from nowhere.
      <P>The CCP=92s ideology is built on the premise that humans can =
conquer=20
      nature and transform the world. The Communist Party attracted many =
people=20
      with its ideals of "emancipating all mankind=94 and =93world =
unity.=94 The CCP=20
      deceived many people, especially those who were concerned about =
the human=20
      condition and were eager to make their own mark in society. =
Thereafter,=20
      these people forgot that there is a heaven above. Inspired by the=20
      beautiful yet misguided notion of =93building heaven on earth,=94 =
they=20
      despised traditions and looked down upon the lives of others, =
which in=20
      turn degraded themselves. They did all of this in an attempt to =
provide=20
      the CCP with praiseworthy service and gain honor.
      <P>The Communist Party presented the fantasy of a =93Communist =
paradise=94 as=20
      the truth, and aroused people=92s enthusiasm to fight for it: =
=93For reason=20
      thunders new creation, `Tis a better world in birth.=94 [1] =
Employing such=20
      an absolute and incredible idea, the CCP severed the connections =
between=20
      humanity and heaven, and cut the lifeline that connects the =
Chinese people=20
      to their ancestors and national traditions. By summoning people to =
give=20
      their lives for Communism, the CCP strengthened its ability to do =
harm.
      <P><B>Second Inherited Trait: Deceit=97Lying in Order to Confound =
Good and=20
      Bad</B>
      <P>Evil must lie. To take advantage of the working class, the CCP=20
      conferred upon it the titles of =93the most advanced class,=94 =
=93selfless=20
      class,=94 =93leading class,=94 and =93pioneers of the proletarian =
revolution.=94=20
      When the Communist Party needed the peasants, it promised =93land =
to the=20
      tiller.=94 Mao applauded the peasants, saying, =93Without the poor =
peasants=20
      there would be no revolution; to deny their role is to deny the=20
      revolution.=94[2] When the Communist Party needed help from the =
capitalist=20
      class, it called them =93fellow travelers in the proletarian =
revolution=94 and=20
      promised them =93democratic republicanism.=94 When the Communist =
Party was=20
      almost exterminated by the KMT, it appealed loudly, =93Chinese do =
not fight=20
      Chinese.=94 Yet what happened? As soon as the anti-Japanese war =
was over,=20
      the CCP turned full force against the KMT and overthrew its =
government.=20
      Similarly, the CCP eliminated the capitalist class shortly after =
taking=20
      control of China, and in the end transformed the peasants and =
workers into=20
      a penniless proletariat.
      <P>The notion of a united front is a typical example of the lies =
the CCP=20
      tells. In order to win the civil war against the KMT, the CCP, =
departing=20
      from its usual tactics, adopted a =93policy of temporary =
unification=94 with=20
      its class enemies, including landlords and rich farmers. On July =
20, 1947,=20
      Mao Zedong announced that =93Except for a few reactionary =
elements, we=20
      should adopt a more relaxed attitude towards the landlord =
class=85in order=20
      to reduce hostile elements.=94 After the CCP gained power, =
however, the=20
      landlords and rich farmers did not escape genocide.
      <P>Saying one thing and doing another is normal for the Communist =
Party.=20
      When the CCP needed to use the KMT, it argued that the two sides =
=93strive=20
      for long-term coexistence, exercise mutual supervision, be sincere =
with=20
      each other, and share honor and disgrace.=94 After seizing power =
in 1949,=20
      however, the CCP eliminated everyone who spoke up for democracy, =
labeling=20
      them anti-party rightists. Anybody who disagreed with or refused =
to=20
      conform to the Party=92s concepts, words, deeds, or organization =
was=20
      eliminated. Marx, Lenin and the CCP leaders have all held that the =

      Communist Party's political power would not be shared with any =
other=20
      individuals or groups. From the very beginning, Communism clearly =
carried=20
      within it the gene of dictatorship. It is despotic; the CCP has =
never=20
      coexisted with any other political parties or groups in a sincere =
manner.=20
      Even during the so-called =93relaxed=94 period, the CCP=92s =
coexistence with=20
      others was at most a choreographed performance.
      <P>History tells us not to believe in any promises the CCP makes, =
nor to=20
      trust that any of the CCP=92s commitments will be fulfilled. To =
believe the=20
      words of the Communist Party could easily cost one his or her =
life.
      <P><B>Third Inherited Trait: Incitement=97Stirring up Hatred and =
Inciting=20
      Struggle among the Masses</B>
      <P>Deceit often serves to incite hatred. Struggle relies on =
hatred. Where=20
      hatred does not exist, it can be created.=20
      <P>The deep-rooted patriarchal clan system in the Chinese =
countryside=20
      served as a fundamental barrier to the Communist Party=92s =
establishment of=20
      political power. The rural society was initially harmonious, and =
the=20
      relationship between the landowners and tenants was not entirely=20
      confrontational. The landowners managed and rented out land to =
peasants,=20
      who then relied on the land for survival. In other words, the =
landowners=20
      offered the farmers a means to survive, and in return the farmers=20
      supported the landowners.=20
      <P>This somewhat mutually dependent relationship was twisted by =
the CCP=20
      into extreme class antagonism and class exploitation. Harmony was =
turned=20
      into hostility, hatred, and struggle. The reasonable was made to =
be=20
      unreasonable, order was made to be chaos, and republicanism made =
to be=20
      despotism. The Communist Party encouraged the denial of private =
property,=20
      murder for profit, and the slaughter of landlords, rich farmers =
and their=20
      families. Many peasants were not willing to take the property of =
others.=20
      Some returned at night the property they took from the landlords =
during=20
      the day, but they were criticized by CCP work teams in rural =
regions as=20
      having =93low class consciousness.=94<BR><BR>To incite class =
hatred, the CCP=20
      reduced the Chinese theater to a propaganda tool. A well-known =
story of=20
      class oppression, the White-Haired Girl, was originally about a =
female=20
      immortal and had nothing to do with class conflicts. Under the =
pens of the=20
      military writers, however, it was transformed into a =93modern=94 =
drama,=20
      opera, and ballet used to incite class hatred.=20
      <P>Inciting the masses to struggle against each other is a classic =
trick=20
      of the CCP. The CCP created the 95:5 formula of class assignment: =
95=20
      percent of the population was assigned to various classes that =
could be=20
      won over, while the remaining 5 percent was designated as class =
enemies.=20
      People within the 95 percent were safe, but those within the 5 =
percent=20
      were =93struggled=94 against. Out of fear and to protect =
themselves, the=20
      people strived to be included in the 95 percent. This resulted in =
many=20
      cases in which people brought harm to others, even adding insult =
to=20
      injury. The CCP has, through the use of incitement in many of its=20
      political movements, perfected this technique.=20
      <P><B>Fourth Inherited Trait: Unleashing the Scum of =
Society=97Hoodlums and=20
      Social Scum Form the Ranks of the CCP</B>
      <P>Unleashing the scum of society leads to evil, and evil must =
utilize the=20
      scum of society. Communist revolutions have often made use of the=20
      rebellion of hoodlums and social scum. The =93Paris Commune,=94 =
for example,=20
      actually involved homicide, arson, and violence led by social =
scum. Even=20
      Marx looked down upon the =93lumpen proletariat.=94 [3] In the =
<I>Communist=20
      Manifesto</I>, Marx said, =93The =91dangerous class,=92 the social =
scum, that=20
      passively rotting mass thrown off by the lowest layers of the old =
society,=20
      may, here and there, be swept into the movement by a proletarian=20
      revolution; its conditions of life, however, prepare it far more =
for the=20
      part of a bribed tool of reactionary intrigue.=94 Peasants, on the =
other=20
      hand, were considered by Marx and Engels to be unqualified to be =
any=20
      social class because of their so-called fragmentation and =
ignorance.
      <P>The CCP developed further the dark side of Marx's theory. Mao =
Zedong=20
      said, =93The social scum and hoodlums have always been spurned by =
the=20
      society, but they are actually the bravest, the most thorough and =
firmest=20
      in the revolution in the rural areas.=94[4] The lumpen proletariat =
enhanced=20
      the violent nature of the CCP. The word =93revolution=94 in =
Chinese literally=20
      means =93taking lives,=94 which sounds horrific and disastrous to =
all good=20
      people. However, the party managed to imbue =93revolution=94 with =
positive=20
      meaning. Similarly, in a debate over the term =93lumpen =
proletariat=94 during=20
      the Cultural Revolution, the CCP felt that =93lumpen=94 did not =
sound good,=20
      and so the CCP replaced it with =93proletariat=94 simply.=20
      <P>Another behavior of the scum of society is to play the rascal. =
When=20
      criticized for being dictators, Party officials would reveal their =

      tendency to bully and shamelessly pronounce something along the =
lines of,=20
      =93You are right, that is precisely what we are doing. The Chinese =

      experience accumulated through the past decades requires that we =
exercise=20
      this power of democratic dictatorship. We call it the =91people's =
democratic=20
      dictatorship.=92=94
      <P><B>Fifth Inherited Trait: Espionage=97Infiltrate, Deceive, =
Betray</B>
      <P>In addition to cheating, inciting violence, and employing the =
scum of=20
      society, the technique of espionage and sowing dissension was also =
used.=20
      The CCP was skillful in infiltration. Decades ago, the =93top =
three=94=20
      outstanding undercover agents of the CCP, Qian Zhuangfei, Li =
Kenong and Hu=20

had them=20
      hand delivered to Zhou Enlai (also spelled as Chou En-lai) [5] by =
Li=20
      Kenong. In April 1930, a special double-agent organization funded =
by the=20
      Central Investigation Branch of the KMT was set up in the =
Northeast region=20
      of China. On the surface, it belonged to the KMT and was managed =
by Qian=20
      Zhuangfei, but behind the scenes it was controlled by the CCP and =
led by=20
      Chen Geng.
      <P>Li Kenong joined KMT=92s Armed Force Headquarters as a =
cryptographer. Li=20
      was the one that decoded the urgent message pertaining to the =
arrest and=20
      revolt of Gu Shunzhang [6], a CCP Security Bureau Director. Qian =
Zhuangfei=20
      immediately sent the decoded message to Zhou Enlai, thereby =
keeping the=20
      whole lot of spies from being caught in a dragnet. <BR><BR>Yang =
Dengying=20
      was a pro-Communist special representative for the KMT=92s Central =

      Investigation Office stationed in Shanghai. The CCP let him arrest =
and=20
      execute those who the CCP considered unreliable. A senior officer =
from=20
      Henan Province once offended a party cadre, and his own people =
pulled some=20
      strings to put him in the KMT's jail for several years.
      <P>During the Liberation War [7], the CCP managed to plant a =
secret agent=20
      whom Chiang Kai-shek (also called Jiang Jieshi) [8] kept in close=20
      confidence. Liu Pei, Lieutenant General and the Deputy Minister of =
the=20
      Department of Defense was in charge of dispatching the KMT army. =
Liu was=20

      suppressing the local tyrants and robbing banks, behaving just =
like=20
      bandits. Soon these =93fund raising=94 missions became one of the =
major tasks=20
      of the Red Army. For example, in a mission led by Li Xiannian, one =
of the=20
      CCP=92s senior leaders, the Red Army kidnapped the richest =

      genocide. Its every political movement in the past was a campaign =

instance, Zhou=20

      <P>One of the early leaders of the CCP was Ren Bishi, who was in =
charge of=20
      opium sales during the anti-Japanese war. Opium was a symbol of =
foreign=20
      invasion at that time, as the British used opium imports to China =
to drain=20
      Chinese economy and turn Chinese people into addicts. Despite the =
strong=20
      national sentiment against opium, Ren dared to plant opium in a =
large=20
      area, risking universal condemnation. Due to the sensitive and =
illegal=20
      nature of the opium dealings, the CCP used the word =93soap=94 as =
a code-word=20
      for opium. The CCP used the revenue from the illicit drug trade =
with=20
      bordering countries to fund its existence. At the Centenary of the =
Birth=20
      of Ren, one of the new generation of Chinese leaders highly =
praised Ren=92s=20

      a model Party member. He also had a firm belief in Communism and =
unlimited=20
      loyalty to the cause of the Party.=94

      said, =93his death is weightier than Taishan,=94 [11] meaning that =

just a=20

eastern=20
      branch of Soviet Communism, carrying out the imperialism of the =
Russian=20

      organizational ideology. Through the use of extreme surveillance =
and=20
      control measures, the Soviet Union was the backbone and patron of =
the CCP.
      <P>The Comintern formulated the CCP constitution established at =
the first=20

      <P>According to declassified Party documents, the CCP received =

its=20

      Soviet Union in case of defeat. The CCP encountered great =
difficulties=20

Shanxi and=20
      Suiyuan. On the one hand by marching through these northern =
provinces,=20
      they could claim to be =93anti-Japanese=94 and win people=92s =
hearts. On the=20
      other hand, those areas were safe as no Japanese troops were =
deployed=20

      <P>In December 1936, Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng, two KMT =

      kidnapped Chiang Kai-shek in Xi'an. This has since been referred =
to as the=20
      Xi'an Incident.
      <P>According to the version of history presented in CCP textbooks, =
the=20
      Xi=92an Incident was a =93military coup=94 initiated by Zhang and =
Yang, who=20
      delivered a life or death ultimatum to Chiang Kai-shek. He was =
forced to=20
      take a stance against the Japanese invaders. Zhou Enlai was =
reportedly=20
      invited to Xi=92an as a CCP representative to help negotiate a =
peaceful=20
      resolution. With different groups in China mediating, the incident =
was=20
      resolved peacefully, thereby ending a civil war of ten years and =
starting=20
      a unified national alliance against the Japanese. The CCP history =
books=20
      say that this incident was a crucial turning point for China in =
her=20
      crisis. The CCP depicts itself as the patriotic party that takes =
the=20
      interests of the whole nation into account.=20
      <P>In fact, at the beginning of the incident, the leaders of the =
CCP=20
      wanted to kill Chiang Kai-shek, avenging his earlier suppression =
of the=20
      CCP. At the time, the CCP had a very weak base in northern Shaanxi =

      province, and had been in danger of being completely eliminated in =
a=20
      single battle. So the CCP, utilizing all its acquired skills of =
deception,=20
      instigated Zhang and Yang to revolt. In order to pin down the =
Japanese and=20
      prevent them from attacking the Soviet Union, Stalin wrote to the =
Central=20
      Committee of the CCP, asking them not to kill Chiang Kai-shek, but =
to=20
      cooperate with him for a second time. Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai =
realized=20
      that they could not destroy the KMT with the limited strength of =
the CCP;=20
      even if they killed Chiang Kai-shek, they would be defeated and =
even=20
      eliminated by the avenging KMT army. Under these circumstances, =
the CCP=20
      changed its tone. The CCP demanded joint resistance against the =
Japanese=20
      and forced Chiang Kai-shek to accept cooperation a second time.=20
      <P>Many CCP spies had already gathered around Yang Hucheng and =
Zhang=20
      Xueliang before the Xi'an Incident. One example was the =
underground CCP=20
      member Liu Ding, who was introduced to Zhang Xueliang by Song =
Qingling,=20
      wife of Sun Yat-sen, a sister of Madame Chiang and a CCP member. =
Liu=20
      played such an important role in instigating the Xi'an Incident =
that Mao=20
      Zedong later praised his outstanding service. Among those working =
at Yang=20

worked in=20
      Yang=92s Political Department of the Army. Xie married Yang =
Hucheng in=20
      January of 1928 with the approval of the CCP. In addition, CCP =
member Wang=20
      Bingnan was an honored guest in Yang=92s home at the time. Wang =
later became=20
      a vice minister for the CCP Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It was =

      members around Yang and Zhang who directly instigated the coup.=20

Kai-shek,=20
      but then turned around and, acting like a stage hero, forced him =
to accept=20
      the CCP. In such a way the CCP not only escaped a crisis of=20
      disintegration, but also used the opportunity to latch onto the =
KMT=20
      government for the second time. The Red Army was soon turned into =
the=20

      comparison, the total size of the CCP=92s New Fourth Army, newly =
grouped in=20
      November of 1937, did not exceed 70,000 people, and its power was =
weakened=20
      further by internal fractional politics. The CCP realized that if =
it were=20
      to face battle with the Japanese, its power would be diminished. =
In the=20
      eyes of the CCP, sustaining its own power rather than ensuring the =

      survival of the nation was the central focus of the emphasis on =
=93national=20
      unity.=94 Therefore, during its cooperation with the KMT, the CCP =
exercised=20

      the CCP fought practically shoulder to shoulder with Japanese =
invaders to=20
      defeat the KMT. In a declaration written in response to the =
Japanese=20
      occupation, the CCP exhorted the people in the KMT-controlled area =
to=20
      rebel, calling on =93workers to strike, peasants to make trouble, =

Japanese,=20
      they only had local armies and guerrilla forces in camps away from =
the=20
      front lines. Except for several battles, including the one fought =
at=20
      Pingxing Pass, the CCP did not make much of a contribution to the =
war=20
      against the Japanese. Instead, they spent their energy expanding =
their own=20
      base. When the Japanese surrendered, the CCP incorporated the =
surrendering=20
      soldiers into its army, claiming to have expanded to more than =
900,000=20
      regular soldiers, in addition to 2 million militia fighters. The =
KMT army=20
      was essentially alone on the frontlines while fighting the =
Japanese,=20
      losing over 200 generals in the war. The commanding officers on =
the CCP=20
      side, however, bore nearly no losses. Even so, the CCP constantly =
claimed=20

occurrence.=20
      People were asked to write repeatedly for the archive, and any =
omissions=20
      would be seen as signs of impurity. One had to describe all social =

      activities they had ever participated in, especially those related =
to=20
      joining the Party. The emphasis was placed on personal thought =
processes=20

with=20

exhaust=20
      the food supply in the city, the People=92s Liberation Army (PLA) =

      <P>From 1947 to 1948, the CCP signed the "Harbin Agreement" and =

If the=20

result,=20
      much of society has become polluted, and large areas have been =
flooded=20
      with Communism or communist elements. The spreading of the CCP has =

      <P>The CCP doesn=92t believe in the principles of morality and =

to keep=20
      changing how it appears on the surface, putting on new skins. =
During the=20
      early period when its survival was at stake, the CCP attached to =
the=20
      Communist Party of the Soviet Union, to the KMT, to the KMT=92s =
governing=20
      body, and to the National Revolution. After capturing power, the =

      <P>Marxism-Leninism is evil in its nature. Ironically, the Chinese =

      <P>The CCP=92s united front is a conjunction of deceit and =
short-term=20
      pay-offs. The goal of unity was to strengthen its power. By =
combining=20
      forces in battles against the Japanese, the CCP could grow from a =
loner to=20
      a huge clan. Unity required discernment=97identifying who were =
enemies and=20
      who were friends; who were on the left, in the middle, on the =
right; who=20
      should be befriended and when, and who should be attacked and =
when. It=20
      easily turned former enemies into friends and then back to enemies =
again.=20
      For example, during the period of the democratic revolution, the =
party=20
      allied with the capitalists; during the socialist revolution it =
eliminated=20
      the capitalists. In another example, leaders of other parties such =
as=20
      Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji were made use of as supporters of the =
CCP=20

persecuted as=20
      =93rightists.=94=20
      <P><B>The Communist Party Is a Sophisticated Professional Gang</B>
      <P>The Communist Party has used two-sided strategies, one side =
soft and=20
      flexible and the other hard and stern. Its softer strategies =
include=20
      propaganda, united fronts, espionage, double-dealing, getting into =

      people's minds, brainwashing, lies and deception, covering up the =
truth,=20
      psychological abuse, and generating an atmosphere of terror. In =
doing=20
      these things, the CCP creates a syndrome of fear inside the Party =
members=92=20
      hearts that leads them easily to forget the Party=92s mistakes. =
These myriad=20
      methods could stamp out human nature and foster maliciousness in =
humanity.=20
      The CCP=92s hard tactics include violence, persecution, political =
movements,=20
      killing and destroying lives, kidnapping, suppressing different =
voices,=20
      armed attacks, periodic crack-downs, etc. These aggressive methods =
create=20
      and perpetuate terror.=20
      <P>The CCP uses both soft and hard methods concurrently. Sometimes =
they=20
      would be relaxed in some instances while strict in others, or they =
would=20
      be relaxed on the outside while stiff in their internal affairs. =
In a=20
      relaxed atmosphere, the CCP encouraged the expression of different =

      opinions, but, as if luring the snake out of its hole, those who =
did speak=20
      up would only be persecuted in the following period of strict =
control. The=20
      CCP often used democracy to challenge the KMT, but when =
intellectuals in=20
      the CCP-controlled areas disagreed with the party, they would be =
tortured=20
      or even beheaded. As an example, we can look at the infamous =
=93Wild Lilies=20
      incident=94, in which the intellectual Wang Shiwei was purged in =
the Yan=92an=20
      rectification movement and executed by the CCP in 1947.=20
      <P>A veteran official who had suffered torments in the Yan=92an=20
      Rectification movement recalled that when he was under intense =
pressure,=20
      dragged and forced to confess, the only thing he could do was to =
betray=20
      his own conscience and make up lies. At first, he felt bad to be=20
      implicating and framing his fellow comrades. He hated himself so =
much that=20
      he wanted to end his life. Coincidentally, a gun had been placed =
on the=20
      table. He grabbed it and, pointing it at his head, pulled the =
trigger. The=20
      gun had no bullets! The person who investigated him walked in and =
said,=20
      =93It=92s good that you admitted what you=92ve done was wrong. The =
Party=92s=20
      policies are lenient.=94 The Communist Party would know that you =
had reached=20
      your limit, know that you were =93loyal=94 to the Party, so you =
had passed the=20
      test. Years later, this official learned about Falun Gong, a =
Qigong and=20
      cultivation practice that started in China. He felt the practice =
to be=20
      good. When the persecution of Falun Gong started, however, his =
painful=20
      memories of the past revisited him, and he no longer dared to say =
that=20
      Falun Gong is good.
      <P>The experience of Emperor Puyi [20] was similar to this =
officer=92s.=20
      Imprisoned in the CCP=92s cells and seeing other people killed, he =
thought=20
      that he would die soon. In order to live, he allowed himself to be =

      brainwashed and cooperated with the prison guards. Later, he wrote =
an=20
      autobiography <I>The First Half of My life,</I>, which was used by =
the CCP=20
      as an example of ideological remolding.=20
      <P>According to modern medical studies, many victims of intense =
pressure=20
      and isolation fall prey to an abnormal sense of dependency on =
their=20
      captors known as the Stockholm Syndrom. The victims=92 moods, =
happiness or=20
      anger, joy or sorrow, would be dictated by those of their captors. =

      There are accounts in which the victims develop =93love=94 for =

exception,=20
      all been labeled anti-communists. Clearly, the CCP has a life of =
its own,=20
      and the party runs the officials and not the other way around. In =
Jiangxi=20
      province, during the war with the KMT, the CCP is known to have =
conducted=20
      internal cleansing operations, executing its own =
soldiers=97stoning them to=20
      death to save bullets. In Shaanxi province, while sandwiched in =
between=20
      the Japanese and the KMT, the CCP began the Yan=92an rectification =
movement=20
      of mass cleansing, killing many. This type of repetitive massacre =
on such=20
      a massive scale did not prevent the CCP from expanding its power =
to all of=20
      China. The CCP imported this pattern of killing from the Soviet =
Union.=20
      <P>The CCP is like a malignant tumor: in its rapid development, =
the center=20
      of the tumor has already died, but it continues to engulf all =
organisms on=20
      the outer edges, expanding its influence. The organisms and bodies =
that=20
      are engulfed by the tumor became part of the cancer. No matter how =
good or=20
      bad a person is to start with, after joining the CCP, he or she =
would=20
      become a part of its destructive force. The more honest the person =
is, the=20
      more destructive he would become. Undoubtedly, this CCP tumor will =

      continue to grow until there is nothing left for it to feed upon. =
Then,=20
      the cancer will surely die.
      <P>The founder of the CCP, Chen Duxiu, was an intellectual and a =
leader of=20
      the May Fourth student movement. He showed himself not a fan of =
violence,=20
      and warned the CCP members that if they attempted to convert the =
KMT to=20
      the communist ideologies or had too much interest in power, that =
would=20
      certainly lead to strained relationships. While one of the most =
active in=20
      the May Fourth generation, Chen was also tolerant. However, he was =
the=20
      first to be labeled a =93right-wing opportunist.=94=20
      <P>Another CCP leader, Qu Qiubai, believed that the CCP members =
should=20
      engage in battles, organize rebellions, overthrow authorities, and =
use=20
      extreme means to return the Chinese society to its normal =
functioning.=20
      However, he confessed before his death that he did not want to die =
as a=20
      revolutionary, since he had left the movement long time ago. He =
sighed=20
      that history played a trick, bringing him, an intellectual, onto =
the=20
      political stage of revolution and keeping him there for many =
years. In the=20
      end, he said he still could not overcome his own gentry notions. =
=93I cannot=20
      become a warrior of the proletariat class.=94
      <P>The CCP leader Wang Ming, at the advice of the Comintern, =
advocated for=20
      unity with the KMT in the war against the Japanese, instead of =
expanding=20
      the CCP base. At the CCP meetings, Mao Zedong and Zhang Wentian =
could not=20
      persuade this fellow comrade, nor could they reveal the truth of =
their=20
      situation: according to the limited military strength of the Red =
Army,=20
      they would not be able to hold back the Japanese by themselves. =
If,=20
      against good sense, the CCP would have decided to fight, then the =
history=20
      of China would certainly be different. Mao Zedong was forced to =
remain=20
      silent at the meetings. Later, Wang Ming was ousted, first for a =
=93left=20
      wing=94 deviation and then branded an opportunist of the right =
wing=20
ideology.
      <P>Hu Yaobang, another party Secretary, who was forced to resign =
in=20
      January of 1987, fought to bring justice to many innocent victims =
who had=20
      been criminalized during the Cultural Revolution. He wanted to =
rejuvenate=20
      Communism in the hearts of the citizens. Still, he was used as a =
scapegoat=20
      in the end.=20
      <P>Zhao Ziyang, the most recent fallen Secretary [21], wanted to =
help the=20
      CCP in furthering reform, yet his actions brought him dire =
consequences.=20
      <P>So what has each leader of the CCP accomplished? Truly to =
reform the=20
      CCP would imply its death. The reformers quickly found their power =
taken=20
      away by the CCP. There is a certain limit on what the CCP members =
can do=20
      to transform the CCP system. All rely on the power rendered by the =
CCP=20
      itself, and so no true reform can succeed with the CCP.=20
      <P>If the Party leaders have all turned into =93bad people,=94 how =
could the=20
      CCP have expanded the revolution? In many instances when the CCP =
was at=20
      its best=97also the most evil, their highest officials failed in =
their=20
      positions. This was because their degree of evil did not meet the =
high=20
      standard of the Party, which has, over and over, selected only the =
most=20
      evil. Many Party leaders ended their political life in tragedy, =
yet the=20
      CCP has survived. The CCP leaders who survived their positions =
were not=20
      those who could influence the Party, but those who could =
comprehend the=20
      Party=92s intentions and follow them. They strengthened the =
CCP=92s ability to=20
      survive while in crisis, and gave themselves entirely to the =
Party. No=20
      wonder they were capable of battling with heaven, fighting with =
the earth,=20
      and struggling against other human beings. But never could they =
oppose the=20
      Party. In the CCP organization, especially at the high level, =
there was a=20
      symbiotic relationship between the leaders and the Party, pursuing =
their=20
      own mutual survival.
      <P>Shamelessness has become a marvelous quality of today=92s CCP. =
According=20
      to the Party, its mistakes were all made by individual Party =
leaders,=20
      e.g., Zhang Guotao or the Gang of Four [22]. Mao Zedong was judged =
by the=20
      Party as having 3 parts mistakes and 7 parts achievements, while =
Deng=20
      Xiaoping judged himself to have 4 parts mistakes and 6 parts =
achievements,=20
      but the Party itself was never wrong. Even if the Party was wrong, =
it says=20
      that it can correct itself. Therefore, the Party tells its members =
to=20
      =93look forward=94 and =93not to be tangled in past accounts.=94 =
Many things could=20
      change: The Communist paradise can turn into a lowly goal of =
socialist=20
      food and shelter; Marx could be replaced with =93Three =
Represents=94; people=20
      would not be surprised to see that the country is becoming =
democratic,=20
      opening up the freedom of belief, abandoning Jiang Zemin =
overnight, or=20
      redressing the persecution of Falun Gong. Other things about the =
CCP,=20
      however, do not change: The fundamental pursuit of the Party=92s=20
      goals=97survival and maintenance of its power and control.=20
      <P>The CCP has mixed violence, terror and high-pressure =
indoctrination to=20
      form its theoretical basis, which is then turned into the Party=20
      principles, the spirit of its leaders, and ultimately the =
Party=92s entire=20
      functioning mechanism and members=92 way of acting. The system, =
its leaders=20
      and members all have assimilated to these ideas. The Communist =
Party is=20
      made of iron and its disciplines have the hardness of steel. The =
intention=20
      of all its members must be unified, and the action of all its =
members must=20
      completely comply with the Party=92s political agenda.
      <P>
      <CENTER>******************</CENTER>
      <P><B>IV. Conclusion</B>
      <P>Why has history chosen the Communist Party over any other =
political=20
      force in China? As we all know, in this world there are two =
forces, two=20
      choices. One is the old and evil, whose goal is to do evil and =
choose the=20
      negative. The other is the righteous and good, which will choose =
the right=20
      and the benevolent. The CCP was chosen by the old forces. The =
reason for=20
      the choice is precisely because the CCP has gathered all the evil =
of the=20
      world, Chinese or foreign, past or present. It is a typical =
representative=20
      of the evil forces. At its inception, the CCP used people=92s =
inborn=20
      innocence and benevolence to cheat, and, step by step, it has =
prevailed in=20
      gaining today=92s capacity to destroy.
      <P>What did the Party mean when it claimed that there would be no =
new=20
      China without the Communist Party? From its founding in 1921 until =
it took=20
      political power in 1949, the evidence clearly shows that without =
deceit=20
      and violence, the CCP would not be in power. The CCP differs from =
all=20
      other types of organizations in that it follows a twisted ideology =
of=20
      Marxism-Leninism, and does what it pleases. It can explain all =
that it=20
      does with high theories and link them cleverly to certain portions =
of the=20
      masses, thus =93justifying=94 its actions. It broadcasts =
propaganda every day,=20
      clothing its strategies in various principles and theories and =
proving=20
      itself to be forever correct.=20
      <P>The development of the CCP has been a process of the =
accumulation of=20
      evil. The history of the CCP tells us precisely its illegitimacy. =
The=20
      Chinese people did not choose the CCP; instead, the CCP forced =
Communism,=20
      this foreign evil specter, onto the Chinese people by applying the =
evil=20
      traits that it has inherited from the Communist Party=97evil, =
deceit,=20
      incitement, unleashing the scum of society, espionage, robbery, =
fighting,=20
      elimination, and control.=20
