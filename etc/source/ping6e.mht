      <P><B>Foreword</B>
      <P>Culture is the soul of a nation. It is as important a spiritual =
factor=20
      to mankind as such physical factors as race and land.
      <P>The history of the civilization of a nation is defined by its =
cultural=20
      developments. The complete destruction of traditional cultures =
will lead=20
      to the end of a nation. No matter how glorious its civilization =
is, even=20
      if its race survives, a nation will vanish when its culture =
disappears.=20
      For example, people will not equate today=92s aborigines living in =
Latin=20
      America with the ancient Mayan race. Destruction of traditional =
cultures=20
      is an unforgivable crime; the destruction of China=92s =
5000-year-old ancient=20
      civilization is even more so.=20
      <P>The traditional culture of China started with such legends as =
Pangu=92s=20
      creation of heaven and the earth [1], Nuwa=92s making of humans =
[2],=20
      Shengnong=92s identification of hundreds of medicinal herbs [3], =
and=20
      Cangjie=92s invention of Chinese characters [4]. The Taoist wisdom =
of the=20
      universe and Confucian moral beliefs course through the veins of =
Chinese=20
      culture. Lao Zi=92s idea of the unity of heaven and humans has =
been=20
      expressed clearly in <I>Tao-te Ching</I> [5], =93Man follows the =
earth, the=20
      earth follows heaven, heaven follows the Tao, and the Tao follows =
what is=20
      natural.=94 The Confucian classic, <I>The Great Learning</I>, =
opened this=20
      way: =93Great learning promotes the cultivation of virtue.=94 This =
was the=20
      very idea Confucius advocated in his teachings, imparting to =
society five=20
      cardinal virtues of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, =
and=20
      faithfulness. In the first century, Sakyamuni=92s Buddhism =
traveled east to=20
      China, and with its promise of compassion and salvation for all =
beings, it=20
      greatly enriched Chinese culture. Thereafter, Confucianism, =
Taoism, and=20
      Buddhism became complementary beliefs in Chinese society, bringing =
the=20
      Tang Dynasty to the peak of its glory and prosperity, as is known =
to all=20
      under heaven.=20
      <P>Although the Chinese nation has repeatedly experienced attacks =
and=20
      undergone destruction, the Chinese culture has shown great =
endurance and=20
      stamina, and its essence has been continuously passed down. The =
unity of=20
      heaven and humanity represents our ancestors=92 cosmology. It is =
commonly=20
      accepted that kindness will be rewarded and evil will be punished. =
It is a=20
      rudimentary principle not to pass on to others what one does not =
want done=20
      to oneself; loyalty, filial piety, prudence, and justice have set =
the=20
      social standards, and Confucius=92 five cardinal virtues have laid =
the=20
      foundation for social and personal morality. With these values, =
the=20
      Chinese culture embodied honesty, kindness, harmony, and =
tolerance.=20
      Ordinary Chinese people have venerated heaven, earth, noblemen, =
relatives,=20
      and teachers. This was reflected in the deep-rooted Chinese =
traditions=20
      that worship God, promote loyalty to the country, uphold values of =
family=20
      and friends, and honor their teachers and elders. The traditional =
Chinese=20
      culture sought harmony between humans and the universe, and =
emphasized an=20
      individual=92s ethics and morality. It was based on the faiths of=20
      Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, and provided the Chinese =
people with=20
      tolerance, social progress, human morality and righteous belief.
      <P>Unlike law, which prescribes hard and fast rules, culture works =
as a=20
      soft constraint. The law enforces punishment after a crime has =
been=20
      committed, while culture, by nurturing morality, prevents crimes =
from=20
      happening in the first place. A society=92s moral values are often =
embodied=20
      in its culture.
      <P>In Chinese history, traditional culture reached its peak during =
the=20
      prosperous Tang Dynasty, coinciding with the height of the Chinese =

      nation=92s power. Science also advanced in unique ways and enjoyed =
a=20
      reputation among all nations. Scholars from Europe, the Middle =
East, and=20
      Japan came to study in Chang=92an, the capital of the Tang =
Dynasty.=20
      Countries bordering China took China as their suzerain state. Many =

      countries came to pay tribute to China and were treated with =
generosity in=20
      return.=20
      <P>After the Qin Dynasty (221-207 B.C.), China was often occupied =
by=20
      minority groups. This happened predominantly during the Sui =
(581-618AD),=20
      Tang (618-907AD), Yuan (1271-1361AD) and Qing (1644-1911AD) =
dynasties and=20
      occasionally in some other times. Nevertheless, these ethnic =
groups were=20
      almost assimilated to the Chinese ways as a whole. This shows the=20
      integrative power of traditional Chinese culture. As Confucius =
said,=20
      =93(Thus) if the people from afar are not compliant, bring them =
around by=20
      cultivating (our) culture and virtue.=94 [6]=20
      <P>Since attaining power in 1949, the CCP has devoted the =
nation=92s=20
      resources to destroying China=92s rich traditional culture. This =
ill=20
      intention did not come from the CCP=92s zealotry for =
industrialization, nor=20
      from simple foolishness in worshipping western civilization. =
Rather, it=20
      came from the CCP=92s inherent ideological opposition to =
traditional Chinese=20
      culture. The CCP=92s destruction of Chinese culture has been =
planned, well=20
      organized, and systematic, made possible by the state=92s use of =
violence.=20
      Since its establishment, the CCP has never stopped =
=93revolutionizing=94=20
      Chinese culture in the attempt to completely destroy its spirit.=20
      <P>What=92s even more despicable is the CCP=92s intentional misuse =
and=20
      underhanded modification of traditional culture during its reign. =
The CCP=20
      has advanced the vile rather than the virtuous, while promoting =
power=20
      struggles, conspiracy, and dictatorship=97all of which existed in =
Chinese=20
      history whenever people diverged from traditional values. The CCP =
created=20
      its own set of moral standards, way of thinking, and system of =
discourses,=20
      and gave the false impression that this =93Party culture=94 is =
actually a=20
      continuation of traditional Chinese culture. The CCP has even =
taken=20
      advantage of the aversion some people have for the =93Party =
culture=94 to=20
      incite public sentiment against traditional culture, thus further=20
      abandoning authentic Chinese tradition.=20
      <P>The CCP=92s destruction of traditional culture has brought =
disastrous=20
      consequences to China. Not only have people lost their moral =
bearings;=20
      they have also been further indoctrinated with the CCP=92s evil =
theories.
      <P>
      <CENTER>******************</CENTER>
      <P><B>I. Why Did the CCP Want to Sabotage Chinese Culture?</B>
      <P><B>The Long Tradition of Chinese Culture Based on Faith and =
Virtue</B>=20
      <P>The authentic culture of the Chinese nation started about 5000 =
years=20
      ago with the legendary Emperor Huang, who is deemed to be the =
earliest=20
      ancestor of the Chinese people. In fact, Emperor Huang was also =
credited=20
      with founding Taoism=97which was also called the Huang-Lao (Lao =
Zi) school=20
      of thought. The profound influence of Taoism on Confucianism can =
be seen=20
      in Confucian sayings, =93Aspire to the Tao, align with virtue, =
abide by=20
      benevolence, and immerse yourself in the arts;=94 =93If one hears =
the Tao in=20
      the morning, one can die without regret in the evening.=94 [6] One =
of the=20
      most important Chinese classics, the <I>Book of Changes (I =
Ching)</I>, is=20
      a record of heaven and earth, yin and yang, cosmic changes, social =
rise=20
      and decline, and the laws of human life. The prophetic power of =
the book=20
      has far surpassed what modern science can conceive. In addition to =
Taoism=20
      and Confucianism, Buddhism, especially Zen Buddhism, has had a =
subtle yet=20
      profound influence on Chinese intellectuals.
      <P>Confucianism expounded on =93the society=94 part of traditional =
Chinese=20
      culture. It emphasized family-based ethics, in which filial piety =
played=20
      an extremely important role. The Chinese people believe that all =
kindness=20
      starts with filial piety. Confucius advocated, =93benevolence,=20
      righteousness, propriety, wisdom and truthfulness,=94 but also =
said, =93Are=20
      filial piety and brotherly love not the roots of benevolence?=94
      <P>Family-based ethics can be naturally extended to guide social =
morality.=20
      Filial piety can be extended to loyalty to the sage king. =93It is =
seldom=20
      that a person with filial piety and brotherly love will be =
inclined to=20
      offend those above.=94[6] Brotherly love can be further extended =
to loyalty=20
      to friends. Confucians believe that in a family, a father should =
be kind,=20
      a son filial, an older brother friendly, and a younger brother =
respectful.=20
      Here, fatherly kindness can be further extended to benevolence of =
the=20
      emperor toward his subordinates. According to <I>The Great =
Learning</I>,=20
      as long as the traditions of a family can be maintained, social =
morality=20
      can naturally be sustained, and thus, the cultivation of the self =
can lead=20
      to prosperity of the family and the nation, and finally peace for =
all=20
      under heaven.=20
      <P>Buddhism and Taoism, in contrast, offer the =93out of the =
society=94 part=20
      of Chinese culture, guiding people in their spiritual improvement. =
The=20
      influence of Buddhism and Taoism can be found to penetrate all =
aspects of=20
      ordinary people=92s lives. Practices that are deeply rooted in =
Taoism=20
      include Chinese medicine, qigong, geomancy (Feng Shui), and =
divination.=20
      These practices, as well as the Buddhist conceptions of heavenly =
kingdom=20
      and hell, the karmic reward of good and the retribution of evil, =
have,=20
      together with Confucian ethics, formed the core of traditional =
Chinese=20
      culture.=20
      <P>The beliefs of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism offered the =
Chinese=20
      people a stable moral system, unchangeable =93so long as heaven =
remains.=94=20
      [7] This ethical system offered the basis for sustainability, =
peace, and=20
      harmony in society.
      <P>Morality belongs to the spiritual realm; thus, it is often =
conceptual.=20
      An important role of culture is to express such an abstract moral =
system=20
      in language that can be commonly understood.
      <P>Take the four great novels in the Chinese culture for example.=20
      <I>Journey to the West</I> itself is a mythical tale. <I>Dream of =
the Red=20
      Mansion</I> starts with a dialog between a spirited rock and the =
Taoist=20
      Reverend Void at the Baseless Cliff of the Great Waste Mountain in =
the=20
      land of the spirit=97this dialog provides the clues for the human =
drama that=20
      unfolds in the novel. <I>Heroes of Water Margins</I> opens with a =
tale of=20
      Hong Taiwei, who mistakenly traveled to the land of evil, a legend =
that=20
      explains the origin of the 108 heroes. <I>The Three Kingdoms</I> =
begins=20
      with a heavenly warning of a disaster, foreshadowing the =
inescapable=20
      conclusion of God=92s will: =93The world=92s affairs rush on like =
an endless=20
      stream; a heaven-told fate, infinite in reach, dooms all.=94 Other =

      well-known stories, such as <I>The Romance of the Eastern Zhou</I> =
and=20
      <I>The Complete Story of Yue Fei</I>, all started with similar =
legendary=20
      tales.
      <P>These novelists=92 use of myths was not a coincidence, but a =
reflection=20
      of a basic philosophy of Chinese intellectuals toward nature and =
humans=97a=20
      contemplation of the divine origin of human life.=20
      <P>These novels have had such a profound influence on the Chinese =
mind=20
      that the characters in them have been used to typify certain moral =
values.=20
      When speaking of =93righteousness=94 as a concept, for example, =
people think=20
      of Guan Yu (160-219 AD) of the <I>Three Kingdoms</I>=97how his =
sense of=20
      honesty transcended the clouds and reached heaven; how his =
unmovable=20
      loyalty to his superior Liu Bei gained him respect even from his =
enemies;=20
      how his bravery in battle prevailed in the most dire situations, =
even his=20
      final defeat in a battle near the Town of Mai; and, especially, =
his=20
      conference as a deity with his son. When speaking of =
=93loyalty,=94 people=20
      naturally think of Yue Fei (1103-1141 AD), a Song Dynasty military =

      commander who willingly placed the country=92s integrity above his =
own life.=20
      Zhuge Liang (181-234 AD), an official of the Shu State during the =
Three=20
      Kingdoms period, embodied complete devotion to one=92s country.
      <P>The Chinese traditional culture=92s eulogy of loyalty and =
justice has=20
      been fully elaborated in these striking stories from writers=92 =
pens. The=20
      abstract moral values have become concretized and embodied in =
cultural=20
      expressions.=20
      <P>Taoism emphasizes truthfulness, Buddhism emphasizes compassion, =
and=20
      Confucianism values benevolence and justice. =93While their forms =
differ,=20
      their purposes are the same=85 they all inspire people to return =
to=20
      kindness.=94 [8]
      <P>The Chinese traditional culture has taught people important =
concepts=20
      and principles, such as heaven, the Tao, God, Buddha, fate,=20
      predestination, benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom,=20
      faithfulness, frugality, a sense of shame, loyalty, filial piety,=20
      prudence, and so on. Many Chinese may be illiterate but they are =
familiar=20
      with traditional plays and operas, through which they learn about=20
      traditional morals. These cultural forms have been extremely =
important in=20
      transmitting Chinese tradition.=20
      <P>Therefore, the CCP=92s destruction of traditional Chinese =
culture is a=20
      direct attack against Chinese morality and undermines the basis =
for peace=20
      and harmony in society.=20
      <P><B>The Evil Communist Theory Opposes Traditional Culture</B>
      <P>The =93philosophy=94 of the Communist Party is the opposite of =
authentic=20
      Chinese traditional culture. Traditional culture respects the =
mandate of=20
      heaven, as Confucius once said, =93Life and death are predestined, =
and=20
      wealth and position are determined by heaven.=94 [6] Both Buddhism =
and=20
      Taoism believe in the divine, the reincarnation cycle of life and =
death,=20
      and the karmic causality of good and evil. The Communist Party, on =
the=20
      contrary, does not simply believe in atheism. Instead, it also =
runs wild=20
      in defying the Tao and assaulting heavenly principles. =
Confucianism values=20
      family, but the <I>Communist Manifesto</I> clearly promulgates =
abolition=20
      of the family. Traditional culture differentiates the Chinese from =
the=20
      foreign, but the <I>Communist Manifesto</I> advocates the end of=20
      nationality. Confucian culture promotes kindness to others, but =
the=20
      Communist Party encourages class struggle. Confucians encourage =
loyalty to=20
      the noblemen and love for the nation, however, the <I>Communist=20
      Manifesto</I> promotes the elimination of nations.=20
      <P>To gain and maintain power in China, the Communist Party first =
had to=20
      plant its immoral thoughts on Chinese soil. Mao Zedong claimed, =
=93If we=20
      want to overthrow an authority, we must first make propaganda, and =
do work=20
      in the area of ideology.=94[9] The CCP realized that the violent =
Communist=20
      theory, which is sustained with arms, is Western ideological =
garbage that=20
      cannot stand up to China=92s profound 5000-year cultural history. =
The CCP=20
      must, then, completely destroy traditional culture, so that =
Marxism and=20
      Leninism can take China=92s political stage.
      <P><B>Traditional Culture Is an Obstacle to the CCP=92s =
Dictatorship</B>
      <P>Mao Zedong once said, fittingly, that he follows neither the =
Tao nor=20
      heaven. [10] Traditional Chinese culture undoubtedly served as a =
huge=20
      obstacle for the CCP=92s defying the Tao and contending with =
heaven.
      <P>Loyalty in traditional Chinese culture does not mean blind =
devotion. In=20
      the eyes of the people, the emperor is a =93son of =
heaven=94=97with heaven above=20
      him. The emperor cannot be correct at all times. Therefore there =
was a=20
      need for remonstrators to point out the emperor=92s mistakes all =
the time.=20
      The Chinese chronicle system also had historians record all the =
words and=20
      deeds of the emperor. Scholastic officials may become teachers for =
their=20
      sage kings, and the behavior of the emperor was judged by the =
Confucian=20
      classics. If the emperor is immoral=97unenlightened to the Tao, =
people may=20
      rise up to overthrow him, such as in the Chengtang=92s attack of =
Jie, or=20
      King Wu=92s removal of Zhou. [11] These uprisings, judged from =
traditional=20
      culture, were not considered violations of loyalty or the Tao; =
instead,=20
      they were seen as enforcing the Tao on behalf of heaven. Take the=20
      well-known military commander Wen Tianxiang (1236-1283AD) for =
example.=20
      Fighting to protect the integrity of the Southern Song Dynasty =
against the=20
      Mongolian troops, Wen never wavered even when the former Song =
Emperor=20
      attempted to persuade him to surrender after he was taken =
prisoner.=20
      Confucians believe, as Mencius said, that =93The people are of =
supreme=20
      importance; the nation comes next; last comes the ruler.=94 [12]=20
      <P>The CCP could by no means accept these traditional beliefs. The =
CCP=20
      wanted to canonize its own leaders and promote personal worship, =
and so=20
      would not allow such long-held concepts such as heaven, Tao, and =
God to=20
      govern from above. The CCP was fully aware that what it did was a =
crime=20
      against heaven and the Tao if measured by the standards of =
traditional=20
      culture. As long as traditional culture existed, people would not =
praise=20
      the CCP as =93great, glorious, and correct;=94 scholars would =
continue the=20
      tradition of risking their lives to uphold justice, criticize the =
regime=92s=20
      wrongdoings, and place the people above the rulers. Thus, the =
people would=20
      not become the CCP=92s puppets, and the CCP could not unify the =
thoughts of=20
      the masses.=20

      <P>Owing to the fact that the traditional culture is rooted in=20

      traditional culture is to extinguish the manifestation of these =
divine=20
      principles in the human world, that is, eradicating the three =
religions=20
      corresponding to them.
      <P>All three major religions, Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism,=20
      encountered destruction in different historical time periods. Take =

      Buddhism for example, it has suffered four major tribulations in =
history,=20
      which are historically known as the San Wu Yi Zong (persecution of =

      Buddhist devotees by four Chinese emperors). The Emperor Taiwu =
[14] of the=20
      Northern Wei Dynasty (386-534AD) and the Emperor Wuzong [15] of =
the Tang=20
      Dynasty (618-907AD) both tried to extinguish Buddhism in order to =
have=20
      Taoism prevail; the Emperor Wu [16] of the Northern Zhou Dynasty=20
      (557-581AD) tried to extinguish Buddhism and Taoism together, but=20
      venerated Confucianism; the Emperor Shizong [17] of the Later Zhou =
Dynasty=20
      (951-960AD) tried to extinguish Buddhism merely to use the Buddha =
statues=20
      to mint coins, and did not touch Taoism or Confucianism.

religions=20

      <P><B>Destruction of Spiritual Beliefs</B>
      <P>In addition to destroying the physical forms of religion and =

      the CCP has also used its utmost capacity to destroy people=92s =
spiritual=20
      identity formed by faith and culture.
      <P>Take the CCP=92s treatment of ethnic beliefs for example. The =
CCP=20
      considered the traditions of the Hui Muslim group to be one of the =
=93Four=20
      Olds=94=97old thought, culture, tradition, habit; therefore it =
forced the Hui=20
      ethnic group to eat pork. Muslim farmers and the mosques were =
required to=20
      raise pigs, and each household had to furnish two pigs to the =
country=20
      every year. In an extremely cruel incident, the Red Guards forced =
the=20
      second highest Tibetan living Buddha, Panchen Lama, to eat human=20
      excrement, while three monks from the Buddhist temple in Harbin,=20
      Heilongjiang Province were ordered to hold a poster board that =
said =93The=20
      hell with sutras=97they are full of shit.=94=20
      <P>In 1971, after an alleged failed coup to seize power from Mao, =
Lin=20
      Biao, the Vice Chairman of the CCP=92s central committee, escaped =
China but=20
      was killed when his plane was said to have crashed in Undurkhan, =
Mongolia.=20
      Later, in Lin=92s Beijing residence at Maojiawan, some Confucian =
quotations=20
      were found. The CCP then started a frantic movement of =
=93Criticizing Lin=20
      Biao and Confucius.=94 A writer pen-named Liang Xiao [47] =
published an=20
      article in <I>The Red Flag</I>, the CCP=92s banner magazine, =
entitled =93Who=20
      is Confucius?=94 The article described Confucius as a madman who =
wanted to=20
      turn history backward, and a deceptive and shrewd demagogue. A =
series of=20
      cartoons and songs followed, demonizing Confucius.
      <P>In this way dignity and sacredness of religion and culture were =

      annihilated.=20
      <P><B>Endless Destruction</B>
      <P>In ancient China, the central government only extended its rule =
to the=20
      county level, below which patriarchal clans maintained autonomous =
control.=20
      So in Chinese history, the destruction, such as the burning of =
Confucian=20
      books by the Emperor Qin Shi Huang [48] in the Qin Dynasty =
(221-207 B.C.)=20
      and the four campaigns to eliminate Buddhism between the fifth and =
tenth=20
      century, went in one direction, i.e., from top to bottom, and did =
not=20
      completely eradicate Buddhism. Confucian and Buddhist classics and =
ideas=20
      continued to survive in the vast spaces of society.<BR><BR>In =
comparison,=20
      the CCP=92s control of society has been far more complete. Incited =
by the=20
      CCP, young students in their puberty destroyed the =93Four Olds=94 =
in a=20
      nationwide grass-root movement that was launched, =93spontaneously =
and=20
      enthusiastically.=94 The CCP=92s extension to villages through =
village-level=20
      party branches controlled society so tightly that the CCP=92s =
movement to=20
      eradicate the =93Four Olds=94 affected every person on every inch =
of land.=20
      <P>While the emperors in Chinese history used violence on the =
people, the=20
      CCP has gone much further by demonizing and repudiating what =
people=20
      consider to be the most beautiful and the most sacred. The =
destruction of=20
      the spirit can often be more damaging and its effect can last even =
longer=20
      than physical destruction alone.
      <P><B>Reforming Intellectuals</B>
      <P>The Chinese characters embody the essence of 5000 years of=20
      civilization. Their forms, pronunciations, idioms and stories =
express=20
      profound cultural meanings. The CCP has not only simplified the =
Chinese=20
      characters, but also tried to replace them with Romanized pinyin, =
which=20
      would remove all cultural tradition from the Chinese characters =
and=20
      language. But the replacement plan has failed miserably, thus =
sparing=20
      further damage to the Chinese language. The Chinese intellectuals =
who=20
      inherited the same traditional culture were not so fortunate as to =
be=20
      spared destruction.=20
      <P>Prior to 1949, China had two million intellectuals. Although =
some had=20
      studied in Western countries, they still inherited some Confucian =
ideas.=20
      The CCP never relaxed its control of the intellectuals, because as =
members=20
      of the traditional scholar class, their ways of thinking played =
important=20
      roles in shaping the thoughts of ordinary people.=20
      <P>In September 1951, the CCP initiated a large-scale =93thought =
reform=20
      movement=94 starting in Peking University. The intellectuals were =
urged to=20
      confess their historical =93mistakes=94 so as to cleanse any=20
      counter-revolutionary elements.=20
      <P>Mao Zedong never liked intellectuals. He once said, =93They =
(the=20
      intellectuals) ought to be aware of the truth that actually many =
so-called=20

though=20
      their hands were dirty and their feet smeared with cow-dung=85=94 =
[50]=20
      <P>The CCP=92s persecution of intellectuals started with various =
forms of=20
      accusations, ranging from the 1951 criticism of Wu Xun [51] for =
=93running=20
      schools by begging=94 to Mao Zedong=92s personal attack, in 1955, =
on writer Hu=20
      Feng as a counter-revolutionary. In the beginning, the =
intellectuals were=20
      not categorized as a reactionary class, but in 1957, after several =
major=20
      religious groups had surrendered through the =93unified front=94 =
movement, the=20
      CCP could focus its energy on the intellectuals. The =
=93Anti-Rightist=94=20
      movement was thus launched.=20
      <P>In February of 1957, claiming to =93let a hundred flowers bloom =
and a=20
      hundred schools of thought contend,=94 the CCP called on =
intellectuals to=20
      voice their suggestions and criticisms to the party, promising no=20
      retaliation. Those intellectuals who were dissatisfied with the =
CCP=20
      because of its suppression and cleansing of =
counter-revolutionaries [52]=20
      and its totalitarian manner of ruling, which included implementing =

      regulations in domains about which the CCP knew little such as the =

      sciences, philosophy, culture and the arts, thought the CCP had =
suddenly=20
      become open and tolerant. They spoke their true feelings, and =
their=20
      criticism grew more and more intense.
      <P>Years later, many people still believe that Mao Zedong only =
started to=20
      attack the intellectuals after becoming impatient with their =
overly harsh=20
      criticisms. The truth, however, turned out to be quite different.=20
      <P>On May 15, 1957, Mao Zedong wrote an article entitled =
=93Situations are=20
      changing=94 and circulated it among senior CCP officials. The =
article said,=20
      =93Recently, the rightists have been behaving fiercely. They want =
to stir up=20
      a category 7 typhoon and attempt to eliminate the CCP.=94 After =
that, those=20
      officials who had been indifferent to the =93let a hundred flowers =
bloom and=20
      a hundred schools of thought contend=94 campaign suddenly became =
active.=20
      Zhang Bojun, Vice President of the Democratic League and head of =
the CCP=92s=20
      Central Organization Department, soon became one of the victims. =
Zhang=92s=20
      daughter recounted, in her memoir <I>The Past Doesn't Disappear =
Like=20
      Smoke</I>, how her father became the number one rightist. Li =
Weihan, the=20
      head of the CCP=92s United Front Department, called Zhang Bojun in =
person to=20
      invite him to a meeting to discuss how to correct the CCP. Zhang =
was=20
      seated on a front row sofa. Not knowing this to be a trap, Zhang=20
      articulated his criticisms of the CCP. According to Zhang=92s =
daughter, =93Li=20
      Weihan appeared relaxed. Zhang thought Li agreed with what he =
said. Nobody=20
      knew Li was pleased to see his prey falling into the trap.=94 =
After the=20
      meeting, Zhang was classified as the number one rightist in China.
      <P>We can cite a string of dates in 1957 that marked proposals or =
speeches=20
      delivered by intellectuals offering criticisms and suggestions: =

invited, and=20
      were offered after Mao Zedong had already sharpened his =
butcher=92s knife.
      <P>All of these intellectuals, predictably, were later labeled =
rightists.=20
      In China, more than 550,000 intellectuals were labeled and =
persecuted as=20
      rightists.=20
      <P>Chinese tradition has it that =93scholars can be killed but =

      humiliated.=94 The CCP was capable of inflicting the utmost =
humiliation on=20
      intellectuals by denying their right to survive unless they =
accepted=20
      humiliation. Even their families were affected. Many intellectuals =

      surrendered and some of them told on others to save themselves. =

      <P>The traditional =93scholarly class,=94 exemplars of social =

      thus obliterated.=20
      <P>Mao Zedong said proudly of his achievements, =93What can =
Emperor Qin=20

killed=20
      46,000 intellectuals. In our suppression of =

      didn=92t we kill some counter-revolutionary intellectuals as well? =
I argued=20
      with the pro-democratic people who accused us of acting like =
Emperor Qin=20
      Shihuang. I said they were wrong. We surpassed him by a hundred =
times=94.
      <P>Indeed, Mao did more than kill the intellectuals. He destroyed =

      <P><B>Creating the Appearance of Culture by Keeping the Semblance =

      <P>After the CCP adopted economic reform and an open-door policy, =

      renovated many churches as well as many Buddhist and Taoist =
temples. They=20
      also organized many temple fairs in China as well as cultural =
fairs=20
      outside of China. This was the latest effort of the CCP to utilize =
and=20
      destroy the remaining traditional culture. On the one hand, the =
Party did=20
      this to appease the essential human kindness that still exists in =
people.=20
      This kindness clashes with and will eventually aid in the =
destruction of=20
      the =93Party culture.=94 On the other hand, the CCP intended to =
use=20
      traditional culture to apply cosmetics to their [true] face in =
order to=20
      cover up their evil nature of deception, wickedness, and violence.
      <P>The essence of culture is its inner moral meaning, while the=20
      superficial forms have only entertainment value. The CCP restored =
the=20
      superficial elements of culture, which entertain, to cover up its =
purpose=20
      of destroying morality. No matter how many art and calligraphy =
exhibits=20
      the CCP has organized, how many culture festivals with dragon and =
lion=20
      dances it has staged, how many food festivals it has hosted, or =
how much=20
      classical architecture it has built, the Party is simply restoring =
the=20
      superficial appearance, but not the essence, of the culture. In =
the=20
      meantime, the CCP promoted its cultural showpieces both inside and =
outside=20
      of China basically for the sole purpose of maintaining political =
power.=20
      <P>Once again, temples are an example. Temples are meant to be =
places for=20
      people to cultivate. Inside a temple people can hear bells in the =
morning=20
      and drums at sunset, see burning oil lamps and show respect to =
Buddha.=20
      People in ordinary human society can also confess and worship =
there. A=20
      pure heart that pursues nothing is particularly emphasized in =
cultivation.=20
      A serious and solemn environment is required for confession and=20
      worshipping. However, those places have been turned into famous =
tourist=20
      sites for the sake of economic gain. Among the people actually =
visiting=20
      temples, how many of them have come right after taking a bath and =
changing=20
      their clothes to cleanse themselves? How many really have come =
with a=20

      mistakes?=20
      <P>Restoring the semblance but destroying the inner meaning of =

      <P><B>III. The Party Culture</B>
      <P>While the CCP was destroying the traditional semi-divine =
culture, it=20
      quietly established its own culture through continuous political=20
      movements. The Party culture has transformed the older generation, =

      poisoned the younger generation and also had an impact on =
children. Its=20
      influence has been deep and broad. Even when many people tried to =
expose=20
      the evilness of the CCP, they couldn=92t help but adopt the ways =
of judging=20
      good and bad, the ways of analyzing, and the vocabulary developed =
by the=20
      CCP, which inevitably carry the imprint of the Party culture.=20
      <P>The Party culture not only inherited and deepened the =
wickedness of the=20
      foreign-born Marxist-Leninist culture, but also skillfully =
combined all=20
      the negative elements from thousands of years of Chinese culture =
with the=20
      violent revolution and philosophy of struggle from the party=92s =
propaganda.=20
      Those negative components include internal strife, forming cliques =
to=20
      pursue selfish interests, employing political trickery to torture =
people=20
      mentally, and appropriating the semblance of culture while =
replacing the=20
      contents. During the CCP=92s struggle for survival in the past =
decades, its=20
      characteristic of =93deceit, wickedness and violence=94 has been =
enriched,=20
      nurtured, and carried forward.=20
      <P>Despotism and dictatorship are the true natures of the Party =
culture.=20
      Its purpose is to serve its own ends in political and class =

freedom of=20
      thought, speech, association, or belief. The mechanism of the =
CCP=92s=20
      domination is very similar to a hydraulic system, relying on high =
pressure=20
      and isolation to maintain its state of control. Even one tiny leak =
could=20
      cause the system to collapse. For example, the Party refused talks =
with=20
      the students during the June 4th incident [53], fearing that if =
this leak=20
      spouted, the workers, peasants, intellectuals and the military =
would also=20
      request dialogue. Consequently, China would have eventually moved =
towards=20
      democracy and the one-party dictatorship would have been =
challenged.=20
      Therefore, they chose to commit murder rather than grant the =
students=92=20

      <P>At the same time, the CCP has created its own system of speech =

      vocabulary and distorts the content of those terms.=20
      <P>One step too far from the truth is fallacy. The CCP party =
culture also=20
      abuses traditional morality. For instance, traditional culture =
values=20
      =93faith,=94 so does the Communist Party in its promotion of =
=93faithfulness and=20
      honesty to the Party.=94 The traditional culture emphasizes =
=93filial piety.=94=20
      The CCP may put people in jail if they do not provide for their =
parents,=20
      but the real reason is that these parents would otherwise become a =

      =93burden=94 to the government. When it fits the Party=92s needs, =
the CCP asks=20
      children to draw clear boundaries from their parents. The =
traditional=20
      culture also stresses =93loyalty=94 and that the people are of =
supreme=20
      importance compared to the ruler and the state. The =93loyalty=94 =
preferred by=20
      the CCP, however, is =93blind devotion=94=97so completely blind =
that people are=20
      required to believe in the CCP unconditionally and obey it=20
      unquestioningly.=20
      <P>The words commonly used by the CCP are very misleading. For =
example, it=20
      called the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communists the =

      =93Liberation War,=94 as if the people were being =93liberated=94 =
from oppression.=20
      The CCP called the post-1949 period =93after the founding of the =
nation,=94=20
      when, in reality, China existed long before that and the CCP =
simply=20
      established a new political regime. The three-year Great Famine =
[63] was=20
      called =93three years of natural disaster,=94 when, in fact, it =
was not at all=20
      a natural disaster but, rather, a complete man-made calamity. Upon =
hearing=20
      these words used in everyday life, however, people unconsciously =
accept=20
      them and the ideologies carried in them, just as the CCP intends.
      <P>In traditional culture, music is taken as a way to constrain =
human=20
      desires. In Volume 24 of the <I>Records of the Historian</I> =
(<I>Shi=20
      Ji</I>) [64], in discussing the <I>Book of Songs</I> (<I>Yue =
Shu</I>),=20
      Sima Qian (145-85 BC) said that the nature of man is peaceful, and =
that=20
      one=92s emotions are affected by external influences. If the =
sentiments of=20
      hate and love are stirred up but not constrained, one will be =
seduced by=20
      endless external temptations and commit many bad deeds. Thus, said =
Sima=20
      Qian, the emperors of the past used rituals and music to constrain =
people.=20
      The songs should be =93cheerful but not obscene, sad but not =
overly=20
      distressing.=94 They should express feelings and desires, yet have =
control=20
      over these sentiments. Confucius said in <I>Analects</I>, =93The =
three=20
      hundred verses of <I>The Odes</I> (one of the six classics =
compiled and=20
      edited by Confucius) may be summed up in a single sentence, =
=91Think no=20
      evil.=92=94=20
      <P>Such a beautiful thing as music, however, was used by the CCP =
as a=20
      method to brainwash the people. Songs like =93Socialism is =
Great,=94 =93There=20
      would be no new China without the Communist Party,=94 and many =
others, have=20
      been sung from kindergarten to the university. In singing these =
songs,=20
      people have gradually accepted the meanings of the lyrics. =
Further, the=20
      CCP stole the tunes of the most popular folk songs and replaced =
them with=20
      lyrics that praise the Party. This has served both to destroy the=20
      traditional culture and to promote the Party.
      <P>As one of the CCP=92s classic documents, Mao=92s =93Speech at =
the Yan'an=20
      Forum on Literature and Arts=94 [65] placed cultural endeavors and =
the=20
      military as =93the two battle fronts.=94 It stated that it was not =
enough to=20
      have just the armed military; an =93army of literary arts=94 was =
also needed.=20
      It stipulated that =93the literary arts should serve politics=94 =
and =93the=20
      literary arts of the proletariat class=85 are the =91gears and =
screws=92 of the=20
      revolution machine.=94 From this system of thinking came =
=93atheism=94 and=20
      =93class struggle=94 as the core of =93the Party culture.=94 This =
goes completely=20
      against traditional culture.=20
      <P>The =93Party culture=94 has indeed rendered distinguished =
service in=20
      helping the CCP win power and control over society. Like its army, =

      prisons, and police force, the Party culture belongs to the same =
brutal=20
      political machine, even though it provides a different kind of=20
      brutality=97=93cultural brutality.=94 This cultural brutality, by =
destroying=20
      5000 years of traditional culture, is sapping the morale of =
society,=20
      diminishing the will of the people, and undermining the =
cohesiveness of=20
      the Chinese nationality.=20
      <P>Today, many Chinese have very little knowledge of traditional =
culture.=20
      Some even equate the 50 years of =93Party culture=94 to the 5000 =
years of=20
      Chinese traditional culture. This is indeed a sorrowful thing for =
the=20
      Chinese people. Many do not realize that when they oppose the =
so-called=20
      traditional culture they are in fact against the =93Party =
culture=94 of the=20
      CCP and not the real traditional culture of China.
      <P>Many people hope to replace the current Chinese system with the =
Western=20
      democratic system. In reality, Western democracy has also been =
established=20
      on a cultural basis, notably that of Christianity, which holds =
that=20
      =93everyone is equal in the eyes of God=94 and thus respects human =
nature and=20
      human choices. How could the despotic, inhuman CCP=92s =93Party =
culture=94 of=20
      the CCP be used as the foundation for a western-style democratic =
system?

      <CENTER>******************</CENTER>
      <P><B>Conclusion</B>
      <P>The traditional culture has experienced attacks since the Song =
Dynasty=20
      and started then to deviate from tradition. After the May 4th =
Movement of=20
      1919, eager intellectuals were quick to turn against traditional =
culture.=20
      They were trying to find a path for China by turning away from the =

      traditional culture toward Western civilization. Still, conflicts =
and=20
      changes in the cultural domain remained a focus of academic =
contention=20
      without the involvement of state forces. When the CCP came into =
existence,=20
      however, it elevated cultural conflicts to a matter of =
life-and-death=20
      struggle for the Party. So the CCP began to exercise a direct =
assault on=20
      traditional culture, using destructive means as well as indirect =
abuse in=20
      the form of =93adopting the dross and rejecting the essence.=94
      <P>The destruction of the national culture was also the process of =

      establishing =93the Party culture.=94 The CCP subverted human =
conscience and=20
      moral judgment, thus driving people to turn their backs on =
traditional=20
      culture. If the national culture is completely destroyed, the =
essence of=20
      the nation will disappear with it, leaving only an empty name for =
the=20
      nation. This is not an exaggerated warning.
      <P>At the same time, the destruction of the traditional culture =
has=20
      brought unthinkable physical damage to society.
      <P>Traditional culture values the unity of heaven and humans and=20
      harmonious co-existence between humans and nature. The CCP has =
declared=20
      endless joy from =93fighting with heaven and earth.=94 This =
culture of the CCP=20
      has led directly to the serious degradation of the natural =
environment=20
      that plagues China to today. Take water resources for example. The =
Chinese=20
      people, having abandoned the traditional value that =93Noblemen =
love fortune=20
      but take it with restraint,=94 have robbed the environment and =
ravaged the=20
      river system. Currently, 75 percent of the 50,000 kilometers of =
China=92s=20
      rivers are unsuitable for fish habitat; 33 percent of groundwater =
has been=20
      polluted compared with even ten years ago, and the situation =
continues to=20
      worsen. A =93spectacle=94 of a strange kind occurred at the Huaihe =
River: A=20
      little child playing in the oil-filled river created a spark that, =
upon=20
      striking the surface of the river, lit a flame five meters high. =
As the=20
      fire surged into the air, more than ten willow trees in the =
vicinity were=20
      burnt to a crisp. One can easily see that it is impossible for =
those who=20
      drink the water not to develop cancer or other diseases. Other=20
      environmental problems, such as desertification and salinization =
in=20
      Northwest China and industrial pollution in developed regions, all =
are=20
      related to the society=92s loss of respect for nature.=20
      <P>Traditional culture respects life. The CCP proclaims that =
=93revolt is=20
      justifiable,=94 and =93struggling against human beings is full of =
joy.=94 In the=20
      name of revolution, the Party could murder and starve to death =
tens of=20
      millions of people. This has led people to devalue life, which =
then=20
      encourages the proliferation of fake and poisonous products in the =
market.=20
      In Fuyang city of Anhui Province, for example, many healthy babies =

      developed short limbs, weak bodies, and enlarged heads. Eight =
babies died=20
      because of this strange disease. After investigation, it was =
discovered=20
      that the disease was caused by poisonous milk powder made by a=20
      black-hearted and greedy manufacturer. Some people feed crabs, =
snakes and=20
      turtles with hormones and antibiotics, mix industrial alcohol with =

      drinking wine, process rice using industrial oils, and whiten =
bread with=20
      industrial brightening agents. For eight years, a manufacturer in =
Henan=20
      Province used recycled oil, oils from crude oil as well as other=20
      carcinogens to produce thousands of tons of poisonous =93cooking =
oil=94 every=20
      month. Producing poisonous foods is not a local or limited =
phenomenon, but=20
      is common all over China. The destruction of the culture and moral =
decay=20
      has contributed to this single-minded pursuit of material gain.=20
      <P>Unlike the absolute monopoly and exclusiveness of the Party =
culture,=20
      the traditional culture has a tremendous integrative capacity. =
During the=20
      prosperous Tang Dynasty, Buddhist teachings, Christianity, and =
other=20
      Western religions co-existed harmoniously with Taoist and =
Confucian=20
      thought. Chinese traditional culture would have kept an open =
attitude=20
      toward modern Western civilization and cultures. The four "tigers" =
of Asia=20
      (Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong) have created a =
=93New=20
      Confucian=94 cultural identity, integrating Confucian morality =
with modern=20
      economic rationality. Their progress has proved that traditional =
culture=20
      is not a hindrance to science and development.=20
      <P>At the same time, authentic traditional culture measures the =
quality of=20
      human life on the basis of happiness from within rather than =
material=20
      comfort from without. Tao Yuanming (365-427 AD) [66] lived in =
poverty, but=20
      he kept a joyful spirit and enjoyed a pastime =93picking asters =
beneath the=20
      eastern fence, gazing upon the Southern Mountain in the =
distance.=94
      <P>Culture offers no answers for questions such as how to expand=20
      industrial production or what social systems to adopt. Rather, it =
plays an=20
      important role in providing moral guidance and restraint. The =
restoration=20
      of traditional culture is the recovery of humility toward heaven, =
the=20
      earth, and nature, respect for life, and fear of God. It will =
allow=20
      humanity to live harmoniously with heaven and earth and to enjoy a =

      heaven-given old age.=20
