      <P><B>Foreword</B>
      <P>The collapse of the socialist bloc headed by the Soviet Union =
in the=20
      early 1990=92s marked the failure of communism after almost a =
century.=20
      However, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) unexpectedly survived =
and still=20
      controls China, a nation with one fifth of the world=92s =
population. An=20
      unavoidable question arises: Is the CCP today still truly =
communist?
      <P>No one in today=92s China, including Party members, believes in =

      communism. After fifty years of socialism, the CCP has now adopted =
private=20
      ownership and even has a stock market. It seeks foreign investment =
to=20
      establish new ventures, while exploiting workers and peasants to =
the=20
      maximal extent. This is completely opposite to the ideals of =
communism.=20
      Despite compromising with capitalism, the CCP maintains autocratic =
control=20
      of the people of China. The Constitution, as revised in 2004, =
still=20
      rigidly states =93Chinese people of various ethnicities will =
continue=20
      adhering to the people=92s democratic dictatorship and socialist =
path under=20
      the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the guidance of=20
      Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong=92s ideology, Deng Xiaoping=92s =
theory and the=20

      <P>=93The leopard has died, but its skin is still left=94 [1]. =
Today=92s CCP=20
      only has =93its skin=94 left. The CCP inherited this skin and uses =
it to=20
      maintain its rule over China.
      <P>What is the nature of the skin inherited by the CCP, i.e., the =
very=20
      organization of the CCP?

      <P><B>I. The Cultish Traits of the CCP</B>
      <P>The Communist Party is essentially an evil cult that harms =
mankind.
      <P>Although the Communist Party has never called itself a =
religion, it=20
      matches every single trait of a religion (Table 1). At the =
beginning of=20
      its establishment, it regarded Marxism as the absolute truth in =
the world.=20
      It piously worshipped Marx as its spiritual God, and exhorted =
people to=20
      engage in a life-long struggle for the goal of building a =

      <P>The Communist Party is significantly different from any =
righteous=20
      religion. All orthodox religions believe in God and benevolence, =
and have=20
      as their destiny instructing humanity about morality and saving =
souls. The=20
      Communist Party does not believe in God and opposes traditional =
morality.
      <P>What the Communist Party has done proves itself to be an evil =
cult. The=20
      Communist Party=92s doctrines are based upon class struggle, =
violent=20
      revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat and have =
resulted in=20
      the so-called =93communist revolution=94 full of blood and =
violence. The red=20
      terror under communism has lasted for about a century, bringing =
disasters=20
      to dozens of countries in the world and costing tens of millions =
of lives.=20
      The communist belief, one that created a hell on earth, is nothing =
but the=20
      vilest cult in the world.
      <P>The communist party=92s cultish traits can be summarized under =
six heads:
      <P><B>1. Concoction of Doctrines and Elimination of Dissidents</B>
      <P>The Communist Party holds up Marxism as its religious doctrine =
and=20
      shows it off as =93the unbreakable truth.=94 The doctrines of the =
Communist=20
      Party lack benevolence and tolerance. Instead, they are full of =
arrogance.=20
      Marxism was a product of the initial period of capitalism when=20
      productivity was low and science was under-developed. It didn=92t =
have a=20
      correct understanding at all of the relationships between humanity =
and=20
      society or humanity and nature. Unfortunately, this heretical =
ideology=20
      developed into the international communist movement, and harmed =
the human=20
      world for over a century before the people discarded it, having =
found it=20
      completely wrong in practice.
      <P>Party leaders since Lenin have always amended the cult=92s =
doctrines.=20
      From Lenin's theory of violent revolution to Mao Zedong's theory =
of=20
      continuous revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, =
to Jiang=20
      Zemin's =93Three Represents,=94 the Communist Party=92s history is =
full of such=20
      heretical theory and fallacy. Although these theories have =
constantly=20
      caused disasters in practice and are self-contradictory, the =
Communist=20
      Party still proclaims it is universally correct and forces the =
people to=20
      study its doctrines.
      <P>Eliminating dissidents is the most effective means for the evil =
cult of=20
      communism to spread its doctrine. Because the doctrine and =
behavior of=20
      this evil cult are too ridiculous, the communist party has to =
force people=20
      to accept them, relying on violence to eliminate dissidents. After =
the=20
      Chinese Communist Party seized the reins of power in China, it =
initiated=20
      =93land reform=94 to eliminate the landlord class, the =
=93socialist reform=94 in=20
      industry and commerce to eliminate capitalists, the =93movement of =
purging=20
      reactionaries=94 to eliminate folk religions and officials who =
held office=20
      before the communists took power, the =93anti-rightist movement=94 =
to silence=20
      intellectuals, and the =93Great Cultural Revolution=94 to =
eradicate=20
      traditional Chinese culture. The CCP was able to unify China under =
the=20
      communist evil cult and achieve a situation where everyone read =
the <I>Red=20
      Book</I>, performed the =93loyalty dance,=94 and =93asked for the =
Party=92s=20
      instructions in the morning and reported to the Party in the =
evening.=94 In=20
      the period after Mao and Deng=92s reigns, the CCP asserted that =
Falun Gong,=20
      a traditional cultivation practice that believes in =
=93Truthfulness,=20
      Compassion and Tolerance,=94 would compete with it for the masses =
and so=20
      intended to eradicate Falun Gong. It therefore initiated a =
genocidal=20
      persecution of Falun Gong, which continues today.
      <P><B>2. Promotion of Leader Worship and Supremacist Views</B>
      <P>From Marx to Jiang Zemin, the Communist Party leaders=92 =
portraits are=20
      prominently displayed for worship. The absolute authority of the =
Communist=20
      Party leaders forbids any challenge. Mao Zedong was set up as the =
=93red=20
      sun=94 and =93big liberator.=94 The Party spoke outrageously about =
his writing,=20
      saying =93one sentence equals 10,000 ordinary sentences.=94 As an =
=93ordinary=20
      party member,=94 Deng Xiaoping once dominated Chinese politics =
like an=20
      overlord. Jiang Zemin=92s =93Three Represents=94 theory is merely =
a little over=20
      40 characters long including punctuation, but the CCP Fourth =
Plenary=20
      Session boosted it as =93providing a creative answer to questions =
such as=20
      what socialism is, how to construct socialism, what kind of party =
we are=20
      building and how to build the Party.=94 The Party also spoke =
outrageously=20
      about the thought of the =93Three Represents,=94 although in this =
case=20
      actually mocking it when saying it is a continuation and =
development of=20
      Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory.
      <P>Stalin=92s wanton slaughter of innocent people, the =
catastrophic =93Great=20
      Cultural Revolution=94 launched by Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping=92s =
order for the=20
      Tiananmen Massacre and Jiang Zemin=92s ongoing persecution of =
Falun Gong are=20
      the dreadful results of the Communist Party=92s heretical =
dictatorship.
      <P>On one hand, the CCP stipulates in its Constitution, =93All =
power in the=20
      People's Republic of China belongs to the people. The organs =
through which=20
      the people exercise state power are the National People's Congress =
and the=20
      local people's congresses at different levels.=94 =93No =
organization or=20
      individual may enjoy the privilege of being above the Constitution =
and the=20
      law.=94 [2] On the other hand, the CCP Charter stipulates that the =
CCP is=20
      the core of the leadership for the Chinese-featured socialist =
cause,=20
      overriding both the country and the people. The chairman of the =
Standing=20
      Committee of the National People's Congress made =93important =
speeches=94=20
      across the country, claiming that the National People's Congress, =
the=20
      highest organ of state power, must adhere to the CCP's leadership. =

      According to the CCP's principle of =93democratic centralism,=94 =
the entire=20
      party must obey the Central Committee of the Party. Stripped to =
its core,=20
      what the National People=92s Congress really insists upon is the=20
      dictatorship of the General Secretary, which is in turn protected =
in the=20
      form of legislation.
      <P><B>3. Violent Brainwashing, Mind Control, Tight Organization =
and No=20
      Quitting Once Admitted</B>
      <P>The CCP's organization is extremely tight: one needs two party =
members=92=20
      references before admission; a new member must swear to be loyal =
to the=20
      party forever once admitted; party members must pay membership =
dues,=20
      attend organizational activities, and take part in group political =
study.=20
      The party organizations penetrate all levels of the government. =
There are=20
      basic CCP organizations in every single village, town, and =
neighborhood.=20
      The CCP controls not only its party members and party affairs, but =
also=20
      those who are not members, because the entire regime must =
=93adhere to the=20
      Party's leadership.=94 In those years when class struggle =
campaigns were=20
      carried out, the =93priests=94 of the CCP religion, namely, the =
Party=20
      secretaries at all levels, always did not know exactly what they =
did other=20
      than disciplining people.=20
      <P>The =93criticism and self-criticism=94 in the party meetings =
serves as a=20
      common, unending means for controlling the minds of party members. =

      Historically, the CCP launched a multitude of political movements =
for=20
      =93purifying the Party members,=94 =93rectifying the Party =
atmosphere,=94=20
      =93capturing traitors,=94 =93purging the Anti-Bolshevik Corps (AB =
Corps) [3]=94=20
      and =93disciplining the Party,=94 periodically testing the =
=93Party nature=20
      (principle)=94 of its members with violence and terror and keeping =
them in=20
      step with the Party forever.
      <P>Joining the CCP is like signing an irrevocable contract to sell =
one=92s=20
      body and soul. With the Party=92s rules being always above the =
laws of the=20
      Nation, the Party can dismiss any party member at will, while the=20
      individual party member cannot quit the CCP without incurring =
severe=20
      punishment. Quitting the Party is considered disloyal and will =
bring about=20
      dire consequences. During the Great Cultural Revolution when the =
CCP cult=20
      held absolute rule, it was well known that if the party wanted you =
dead,=20
      you could not live; if the party wanted you alive, you could not =
die. If a=20
      person committed suicide, he would be labeled as =93dreading the =
people=92s=20
      punishment for his crime=94 and his family members would also be =
implicated=20
      and punished.
      <P>The decision process within the Party operates like a black =
box, as the=20
      intra-party struggles must be kept in absolute secrecy. Party =
documents=20
      are all confidential. Dreading exposure of their criminal acts, =
the CCP=20
      frequently tackles dissidents by charging them with =93divulging =
state=20
      secrets.=94
      <P><B>4. Urging Violence, Carnage and Sacrifice for the Party</B>
      <P>Mao Zedong said, =93A revolution is not a dinner party, or =
writing an=20
      essay, or painting a picture, or doing embroidery; it cannot be so =

      refined, so leisurely and gentle, so temperate, kind, courteous,=20
      restrained and magnanimous. A revolution is an insurrection, an =
act of=20
      violence by which one class overthrows another.=94 [4]
      <P>Deng Xiaoping remarked, =93Killing 200,000 people in exchange =
for 20=20
      years=92 stability.=94
      <P>Jiang Zemin ordered, =93Destroy them (Falun Gong practitioners) =

      physically, defame their reputation, and bankrupt them =
financially.=94
      <P>The CCP promotes violence, and has killed countless people =
throughout=20
      its previous political movements. It educates people to treat the =
enemy=20
      =93as cold as the severe winter.=94 The Red Flag is taken red for =
having been=20
      =93dyed red with martyrs=92 blood.=94 The Party worships red due =
to its=20
      addiction to blood and carnage.
      <P>The CCP makes an exhibition of =93heroic=94 examples to =
encourage people to=20
      sacrifice for the Party. When Zhang Side died working in a kiln to =
produce=20
      opium, Mao Zedong praised his death as =93heavy as Mount Tai =
[5].=94 In those=20
      frenzied years, =93brave words=94 such as =93Fear neither hardship =
nor death=94=20
      and =93Bitter sacrifice strengthens bold resolve; we dare to make =
the sun=20
      and moon shine in new skies=94 gave aspirations substance amidst =

      an evil cult that commits crimes a thousand times worse, harming =

features=20

      <P><B>The Evil Cult Became a State Religion</B>
      <P>In most countries, if you do not follow the majority religion, =

the CCP.=20
      Loyalty to the CCP is the first priority before entertaining any =
other=20
      beliefs, according to the very cultish logic of the CCP.
      <P><B>Social Controls Go to Extremes</B>
      <P>This evil cult was able to become a state religion, because the =
CCP had=20
      complete social control and deprived individuals of freedom. This =

neighborhoods.=20

      <P>One might say that private ownership is allowed now by the CCP, =
but we=20

came about=20
      when socialism reached a point where people did not have enough to =

      the national economy was on the brink of collapse. The CCP had to =
take a=20
      step back in order to save itself from destruction. Nevertheless, =
even=20

Party.=20

      its survival.=20
      <P>Among CCP leaders, Mao Zedong was the most adept at mastering =
this=20
      treasured weapon of brutal struggle within the Party. The =
brutality of=20
      such a struggle and the malevolence of its methods began as early =
as the=20
      1930s in areas controlled by the Chinese Communists, the so-called =
=93Soviet=20
      Area.=94=20
      <P>In 1930, Mao Zedong initiated a full-scale revolutionary terror =
in the=20
      Soviet Area in Jiangxi Province, known as the cleansing of =
Anti-Bolshevik=20
      Corps, or the AB Corps. Thousands of Red Army soldiers, Party and =
League=20
      members and civilians in the Communist bases were brutally =
murdered. The=20
      incident was caused by Mao=92s despotic control. After Mao =
established the=20
      Soviet Area in Jiangxi, he was soon challenged by the local Red =
Army and=20
      Party organizations in southwest Jiangxi led by Li Wenlin. Mao =
could not=20
      stand any organized oppositional force right under his nose and he =
used=20
      the most extreme methods to suppress the Party members he =
suspected of=20
      being dissidents. To create a stern atmosphere for the cleansing, =
Mao did=20
      not hesitate to start with troops under his direct control. From =
late=20
      November to mid December, the First Front Red Army went through a =
=93quick=20
      cleaning.=94 Organizations for purging counterrevolutionaries were =

      established at every single level in the army, including division, =

      regiment, battalion, company, and platoon, arresting and killing =
Party=20
      members who were from families of landlords or rich farmers and =
those who=20
      had complaints. In less than one month, among more than 40,000 Red =
Army=20
      soldiers, 4,400 were named as AB Corps elements, including more =
than 10=20
      captains (the AB Corps captains); all of them were executed.
      <P>In the following period, Mao began to punish those dissidents =
in the=20
      Soviet Area. In December of 1930, he ordered Li Shaojiu, Secretary =
General=20
      of General Political Department of the First Front Red Army and =
Chairman=20
      of Purge Committee to represent the General Frontier Committee and =
go to=20
      the town of Futian in Jiangxi Province where the Communist =
government is=20
      located. Li Shaojiu arrested members of the Provincial Action =
Committee=20
      and eight chief leaders of the 20th Red Army, including Duan =
Liangbi and=20
      Li Baifang. He used many cruel torture methods such as beating and =
burning=20
      the body - people who were tortured like this had injuries all =
over their=20
      bodies, fingers fractured, burns all over and could not move. =
According to=20
      historical materials, the victims=92 cries were so loud as to =
pierce the=20
      sky; the cruel torture methods were extremely inhumane.=20
      <P>On December 8, the wives of Li Baifang, Ma Ming and Zhou Mian =
went to=20
      visit their husbands in detention, but they were also arrested as =
members=20
      of the AB Corps and cruelly tortured. They were severely beaten, =
their=20
      bodies and vulvae burned and breasts cut with knives. Under the =
cruel=20
      torture, Duan Liangbi confessed that Li Wenlin, Jin Wanbang, Liu =
Di, Zhou=20
      Mian, Ma Ming and others were leaders of the AB Corps and that =
there were=20
      many members of AB Corps in the Red Army=92s schools.=20
      <P>From December 7 to the evening of December 12, in merely five =
days, Li=20
      Shaojiu and others arrested more than 120 alleged AB Corps members =
and=20
      dozens of principal counter-revolutionaries in the severe AB Corps =

      cleansing in Futian; more than 40 people were executed. Li =
Shaojiu=92s cruel=20
      acts finally triggered the =93Futian Incident=94 [11] on December =
12, 1930=20
      that highly astounded the Soviet Area. [3]
      <P>From the Soviet Area to Yan=92an, Mao relied on his theory and =
practice=20
      of struggle and gradually sought and established his absolute =
leadership=20
      of the Party. After the CCP came to power in 1949, Mao continued =
to reply=20
      on this kind of inner-party struggle. For example, in the eighth =
plenum of=20
      the Eighth CCP Central Committee meeting held in Lushan in 1959, =
Mao=20
      Zedong launched a sudden attack on Peng Dehuai and removed him =
from his=20
      position [12]. All of the central leaders who attended the =
conference were=20
      asked to take a stand; the few who dared to express different =
opinions=20
      were all labeled the Peng Dehuai antiparty bloc. During the =
Cultural=20
      Revolution, the veteran cadres at the CCP=92s Central Committee =
were=20
      punished one after another, but all of them gave in without =
putting up a=20
      fight. Who would dare to speak a word against Mao Zedong? The CCP =
has=20
      always emphasized iron discipline, loyalty to the Party, and=20
      organizational principles, requiring absolute obedience to the =
hierarchy=92s=20
      leader. This kind of party principle has been engrained in the =
continuous=20
      political struggles.
      <P>Li Lisan, once a CCP leader, was driven to the end of his rope =
during=20
      the Cultural Revolution. At 68 years of age, he was interrogated =
on=20
      average seven times per month. His wife Li Sha was treated as "the =
Soviet=20
      revisionist" spy, and had already been sent to jail; her =
whereabouts were=20
      unknown. With no other choice and in extreme despair, Li committed =
suicide=20
      by swallowing a large quantity of sleeping pills. Before his =
death, Li=20
      Lisan wrote a letter to Mao Zedong, truly reflecting "the Party=20
      principle,=94 according to which a CCP member does not dare to =
give up, even=20
      on the verge of death:
      <P><I>

      <P>While Mao Zedong's philosophy of struggle eventually dragged =
China into=20
      an unprecedented catastrophe, this kind of political campaign and =
the=20
      inner-party struggle, which is widespread once "every seven or =
eight=20

was a=20

      remaining 95 percent would be brought to an obedient adherence to =
the=20
      Party=92s basic line, thereby enhancing the Party organization's =
cohesive=20
      force and destructive capacity. These struggles also eliminated =
those=20
      "faltering" members who were not willing to give up their =
conscience, and=20
      attacked any force that dared to resist. Through this mechanism of =

      struggle, those CCP members who have the greatest desire for =
struggle and=20
      are best at using the methods of hoodlums have gained control. The =
CCP=20
      cult leaders are all fearless people rich in the experience of =
struggle=20
      and full of the Party spirit. Such brutal struggle also gives =
those who=20
      have experienced it a "blood lesson" and violent brainwashing. At =
the same=20
      time, it continuously energizes the CCP, further strengthening its =
desire=20
      for struggle, ensuring its survival, and preventing it from =
becoming a=20
      temperate group that gives up the struggle.
      <P>This kind of party principle required by the CCP has come =
precisely=20
      from the CCP's cult nature. In order to realize its goal, the CCP =
is=20
      determined to break away from all traditional principles, and use =
all=20
      means to fight unhesitatingly with any force that hinders it. =
Therefore it=20
      needs to train and enslave all its members to become the Party=92s =

      heartless, unjust and faithless tool. This nature of the CCP =
originates=20
      from its hatred toward human society and traditions, its =
delusional=20
      self-evaluation, and its extreme selfishness and contempt for =
other=20
      people=92s lives. In order to achieve its so-called ideal, the CCP =
used=20
      violence at all costs to smash the world and eliminate all =
dissidents.=20
      Such an evil cult would meet with opposition from people of =
conscience, so=20
      it must eliminate people's conscience and benevolent thoughts to =
make=20
      people believe in its evil doctrine. Therefore, in order to ensure =
its=20
      survival, the CCP first of all must destroy people's conscience,=20
      benevolent thoughts and moral standards, turning people into tame =
slaves=20
      and tools. According to the CCP's logic, the Party's life and =
interest=20
      override everything else; they even override the collective =
interest of=20
      all Party members, thus any individual Party member must be =
prepared to=20
      sacrifice for the Party.
      <P>Looking at the CCP's history, individuals who retained the =
mindset of=20
      traditional intellectuals like Chen Duxiu and Qu Qiubai, or who =
still=20
      cared about people=92s interests like Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang, =
or who are=20
      determined to be clean officials and bring real service to the =
people such=20
      as Zhu Rongji=97no matter how much they contributed to the Party, =
and no=20
      matter how devoid of personal ambitions they were, they were =
inevitably=20
      purged, cast aside, or restricted by the Party's interests and =
discipline.=20

      <P>The Party principle that was fostered in their bones over many =
years of=20
      struggle often made them compromise and surrender in critical =
moments=20
      because in their subconscious, the Party's survival is the highest =
good.=20
      They would rather sacrifice themselves and watch the evil force =
commit=20
      murder, than challenge the Party=92s survival with their =
conscientious and=20
      compassionate thoughts. This is precisely the result of the CCP's=20
      mechanism of struggle: it turns good people into tools that it =
uses, and=20
      uses the Party principle to limit and even eliminate human =
conscience to=20
      the greatest extent. Dozens of the CCP=92s "line struggles" =
brought down=20
      more than 10 top-level Party leaders or designated successors; =
none of the=20
      top Party leaders came to a good end. Although Mao Zedong had been =
the=20
      king for 43 years, shortly after he died, his wife and nephew were =
put in=20
      jail, which was cheered by the entire Party as a great victory of =
Maoism.=20
      Is this a comedy or a farce?
      <P>After the CCP seized political power, there were unceasing =
political=20
      campaigns, from inner-party fights to struggles outside the Party. =
This=20
      was the case during the Mao Zedong era, and is still the case in =
the=20
      post-Mao era of "reform and openness.=94 In the 1980s, when people =
just=20
      began to have a slight bit of freedom in their thinking, the CCP =
launched=20
      the campaign of "Opposition to Bourgeois Liberalization," and =
proposed=20
      "the Four Fundamental Principles" [14] in order to maintain its =
absolute=20
      leadership. In 1989, the students who peacefully asked for =
democracy were=20
      bloodily suppressed because the CCP does not allow democratic =

      The 1990s witnessed a rapid increase in Falun Gong practitioners =
who=20
      believe in Truthfulness, Compassion and Tolerance, but they were =
met with=20
      genocidal persecution beginning in 1999, because the CCP cannot =
tolerate=20
      human nature and benevolent thoughts. It must use violence to =
destroy=20
      people=92s conscience and ensure its own power. Since entering the =
21st=20
      century, the Internet has connected the world together, but the =
CCP has=20
      spent great sums of money in setting up network blockades to trap =

      <P><B>VII. Reflections on the Evil Rule of the CCP</B>
      <P><B>What Is the Communist Party?</B>
      <P>This seemingly simple question has no simple answers. Under the =

      pretense of being =93for the public=94 and in the guise of a =
political party,=20
      the Communist Party has indeed deceived millions of people. And =
yet it is=20
      not a political party in the ordinary sense, but a harmful and =
evil cult=20
      possessed by an evil specter. The Communist Party is a living =
being who=20
      manifests in this world through the Party organizations. What =
truly=20
      controls the Communist Party is the evil specter that first =
entered it,=20
      and it is that evil specter that determines the evil nature of the =

      Communist Party.=20
      <P>The leaders of the Communist Party, while acting as the gurus =
of the=20
      cult, serve only as the mouthpiece of the evil specter and the =
Party. When=20
      their will and purpose are in line with the Party and can be used =
by it,=20
      they will be chosen as leaders. But when they can no longer meet =
the needs=20
      of the Party, they will be ruthlessly overthrown. The mechanism of =

      struggle of the Party makes sure that only the craftiest, the most =
evil,=20
      and the toughest ones will hold steadily to the position of guru =
of the=20
      Communist Party. A dozen or so ranking party leaders have fallen =
from=20
      grace, which proves the truth of this argument. In fact, the top =
leaders=20
      of the Party are walking on a very narrow tight rope. They can =
either=20
      break away from the Party line and leave a good name in history, =
as=20
      Gorbachev did or be victimized by the Party like many general =
secretaries=20
      of the Party.=20
      <P>The people are the targets of the Party=92s enslavement and =
oppression.=20
      Under the Party=92s rule, people have no rights to reject the =
Party. Instead=20
      they are forced to accept the Party=92s leadership and fulfill the =

      obligation to sustain the Party. They are also subjected to =
regular cult=20
      type brainwashing under the threat of coercion from the Party. The =
CCP=20
      forces the whole nation to believe in and sustain this evil cult. =
This is=20
      rarely seen in the world today, and we have to recognize the =
CCP=92s=20
      unmatchable skill in such oppression.=20
      <P>The party members are a physical mass that has been used to =
fill up the=20
      body of the Party. Many among them are honest and kind, and may =
even be=20
      quite accomplished in their public life. These are the people the =
CCP=20
      likes to recruit, for their reputation and competence may used to =
serve=20
      the Party. Many others, out of their desire to become an official =
and=20
      enjoy a higher social status, would work hard to join the Party =
and aid=20
      the evil being. There are also those who chose to join the Party =
because=20
      they want to accomplish something in their lives and realized that =
under=20
      the Communist rule they could not do so unless they joined the =
Party. Some=20
      joined the Party because they wanted the allocation of an =
apartment or=20
      simply wanted a better image. Thus among the tens of millions of =
Party=20
      members, there are both good and bad people. Regardless of =
motives, once=20
      you swear your allegiance in front of the Party=92s flag, =
willingly or=20
      otherwise, that means you have voluntarily devoted yourself to the =
Party.=20
      You will then go through the brainwashing process by participating =
in the=20
      weekly political studies. A significant number of Party members =
will have=20
      little if any of their own thoughts left and would be easily =
controlled by=20
      the evil specter of the CCP host body as a result of the =
indoctrination by=20
      the Party. These people will function within the Party like the =
cells of a=20
      human body, and work non-stop for the Party=92s existence, even =
though they=20
      themselves are also part of the population enslaved by the Party. =
Sadder=20
      still, after the bondage of the =93party principle=94 is imposed =
on you, it=20
      becomes very hard to take it off. Once you show your human side, =
you will=20
      be purged or persecuted. You cannot withdraw from the Party on =
your own=20
      even if you want to, for the Party, with its entrance-yes and =
exit-no=20
      policy, would regard you as a traitor. That is why people often =
reveal a=20
      dual-nature: in their political life the nature of the Communist =
Party,=20
      and in their daily life human nature.=20
      <P>The Party Cadres are a group that retains power among Party =
members.=20
      Though they may have choices between good and bad and make their =
own=20
      decisions on specific occasions, at specific times, and specific =
events,=20
      they, as a whole, have to follow the will of the Party. The =
mandate=20
      dictates =93the whole Party obeys the Central Committee.=94 The =
Party Cadres=20
      are the leaders at different levels; they are the Party=92s =
backbones. They=20
      too are merely tools for the Party. They, too, have been deceived, =
used=20
      and victimized during the past political movements. The CCP=92s =
underlying=20
      criterion is to test whether you are following the right guru and =
are=20
      sincere in your devotion.
      <P><B>Why Do People Remain Unaware?</B>
      <P>The CCP has acted viciously and wickedly throughout its more =
than=20
      50-year rule over China. But why do the Chinese people lack a =
realistic=20
      understanding of the CCP=92s evil nature? Is it because the =
Chinese are=20
      dumb? No. The Chinese constitute one of the wisest nations in the =
world=20
      and boast a rich traditional culture and heritage of 5000 years. =
Yet the=20
      Chinese people are still living under the CCP=92s rule, completely =
afraid of=20
      expressing their discontent. The key lies in the mind-control =
practiced by=20
      the CCP.=20
      <P>If the Chinese people enjoyed freedom of expression and could =
debate=20
      openly the merits and problems of the CCP, we could imagine the =
Chinese=20
      would have long ago seen through the evil nature of the CCP and =
freed=20
      themselves from the influence of this evil cult. . Unfortunately, =
the=20
      Chinese people lost their freedom of expression and thought over =
half a=20
      century ago with the advent of the CCP=92s rule. The purpose =
behind=20
      persecution of the rightists among the intellectuals in 1957 was =
to=20
      restrain free expression and to control people=92s minds. In a =
society so=20
      lacking fundamental freedoms, most of the youth who had =
wholeheartedly=20
      studied the works of Marx and Engels during the Cultural =
Revolution have=20
      ironically been labeled as an =93anti-Party clique=94 and are =
subsequently=20
      persecuted. Discussing the CCP=92s rights and wrongs was simply =
out of the=20
      question.=20
      <P>Not many Chinese would even dare to think of calling the CCP an =
evil=20
      cult. However, were that assertion made, those who have lived in =
China=20
      would not find it hard to discover strong evidence supporting the=20
      argument, from both their own experience and those of their family =
and=20
      friends.=20
      <P>The Chinese people have not only been deprived of freedom of =
thought,=20
      they have also been indoctrinated with the teachings and culture =
of the=20
      Party. Thus, all that people could hear have been the praises of =
the=20
      Party, and their minds have been impoverished of any thought other =
than=20
      ideas that reinforce the CCP. Take the Tiananmen Massacre for =
example.=20
      When shots were fired on June 4th, 1989, many people instinctively =
ran to=20
      hide in the bushes. Moments later, despite the risks, they came =
bravely=20
      out of hiding and sang =93The Internationale=94 together. These =
Chinese were=20
      indeed courageous, innocent and respectable, yet why did they sing =
=93The=20
      Internationale,=94 the Communist anthem, when confronted with the =
Communist=20
      killing? The reason is simple. Educated in the Party=92s culture, =
all the=20
      pitiable people know is Communism. Those in Tiananmen Square did =
not know=20
      any songs other than =93The Internationale=94 and a few other =
songs that=20
      praise the Communist Party.=20
      <P><B>What Is the Way Out?</B>
      <P>The CCP has been moving towards its complete doom. Sadly, it is =
still=20
      trying to tie its fate to the Chinese nation before its demise.=20
      <P>The dying CCP is apparently weakening and its control over =
people=92s=20
      minds is loosening. With the advance of telecommunications and the =

      internet, the CCP is finding it difficult to control information =
and=20
      suppress expression. As the corrupt officials increasingly plunder =
and=20
      oppress the people, the public is beginning to wake up from their=20
      illusions about the CCP, and many of them have started to exercise =
civil=20
      disobedience. The CCP has not only failed to achieve its goal of =
increased=20
      ideological control in its persecution of Falun Gong, but also =
further=20
      weakened itself while revealing its absolute ruthlessness. This =
opportune=20
      moment has made people reconsider the CCP, paving the way for the =
Chinese=20
      nation to free itself from the ideological bondage and completely =
break=20
      away from the control of the Communist evil specter.
      <P>Having lived under the evil rule of the CCP for over 50 years, =
the=20
      Chinese people do not need a violent revolution; rather, they need =

      redemption of their souls. This can be achieved through self-help, =
and the=20
      first step towards that goal is to become aware of the evil nature =
of the=20
      CCP.=20
      <P>The day will come when people cast aside the Party=92s =
organizations that=20
      are attached to the state apparatus, allowing the social systems =
to=20
      function independently, backed up by the core forces of the =
society. With=20
      the passing of a dictatorial Party organization, the efficiency of =
the=20
      government will be improved and enhanced. And that day is right =
around the=20
      corner. In fact, as early as the 1980s, the reformers inside the =
Party=20
      advocated the idea of =93separating the Party from the =
government,=94 in an=20
      attempt to exclude the Party from the government. The reform =
efforts from=20
      within the CCP have proven to be inadequate and unsuccessful when =
the=20
      notion of =93the absolute leadership of the Party=94 is not =
totally rejected=20
      ideologically.=20
      <P>The Party culture is the environment necessary for the survival =
of the=20
      communist evil cult. Removing the CCP=92s possession of people=92s =
minds may=20
      prove to be more difficult than clearing out the CCP=92s =
possession of state=20
      administrations, but such a removal is the only way to truly =
uproot the=20
      evil of Communism. This can be achieved only through the efforts =
of the=20
      Chinese people themselves. With their minds set right and human =
nature=20
      returned to its original state, the public would regain its =
morality and=20
      succeed in a transition to a decent non-Communist society. The =
cure for=20
      this evil possession lies in the recognition of the evil =
specter=92s nature=20
      and harmfulness, eradicating it from people=92s minds, and =
clearing it out,=20
      so that it has no place to hide. The Communist Party stresses =
ideological=20
      control, since it is nothing but an ideology itself. That ideology =
will=20
      dissipate when all Chinese reject the Communist falsehood in their =
minds,=20
      actively wipe out the Party culture, and rid their own mentalities =
and=20
      lives of the influences from the communist evil cult. As people =
save=20
      themselves, the CCP will disintegrate.=20
      <P>Nations ruled by Communists are associated with poverty,=20
      totalitarianism, and persecution. There are very few such nations =
left,=20
      including China, North Korea, Vietnam, and Cuba. Their days are =
numbered.=20
      <P>With the wisdom of the Chinese people, backed by the =
inspiration of the=20
      historical glory of the Chinese nation, a China freed from the =
evil=20
      possession of communism will be a promising nation.=20
      <P>
      <CENTER>******************</CENTER>
      <P><B>Conclusion</B>
      <P>The CCP no longer believes in communism. Its soul has died, but =
its=20
      shadow remains. It has inherited only the =91skin=92 of communism, =
but still=20
      manifests the nature of an evil cult: arrogance, conceit and =
selfishness,=20
      and indulgence in wanton destructiveness. The CCP has inherited =
the=20
      Communist denial of the law of heaven, and its rejection of human =
nature=20
      has remained unchanged.=20
      <P>Today, the CCP continues to rule China with the methods of =
struggle=20
      mastered over the years, using its close-knit organizational =
system=20
      coupled with the ruling form of =93Party possession,=94 as well as =
evil=20
      propaganda that functions as a state-religion. The six features of =
the=20
      Communist Party outlined in the previous article place today=92s =
CCP firmly=20
      within the definition of an =93evil cult=92: it does no good, only =
evil.=20
      <P>As it nears death, this Communist evil cult is accelerating the =
pace of=20
      its corruption and degeneration. What is most troublesome is that =
it is=20
      stubbornly doing what it can to take the Chinese nation with it =
into an=20
      abyss of corruption and degeneration.=20
      <P>The Chinese need to help themselves; they need to reflect, and =
they=20
      need to shake off the CCP.
